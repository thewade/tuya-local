    Tests: stricter checking on state_class.
    
    When class is at dp level, it corresponds to state_class (for sensors only),
    which has a small set of fixed possible values.
    
    As inexperienced users tend to confuse this with the device_class (class at
    entity level), it will help to check this more thoroughly.

    Aubess 2-gang: add compatible double garage door controller
    
    - Double garage door controller with no feedback, so unable to make a
      meaningful cover implementation for it. Seems compatible with Aubess
      2-gang (most likely with switch type set to button when used with
      garage door controller).
    - From original report (this is one of the earlier devices), we only had
      "flip" as a value for dp 47.  flip/sync/button from Universal RX multi
      garage door receiver matches other switches and is likely matching the
      Aubess, so add it as a control. Other dps seem to follow general standard
      mappings for switches we have since discovered, so are likely also matching.
      Add dp 48 (switch_interlock) from the garage door controller as optional.
      It was not in the Aubess logs, but since it is raw format, we can't do
      much with it other than add as an attribute for monitoring, so not worth
      creating a new config for.

    init: load config in executor job

    load in a separate executor job to avoid blocking the main loop.

    Moebot S: make "Problem" sensor optional, defaulting to "OK"
    
    Although this seems to have some non-problematic statuses, it is
    reportedly stuck on "Tilted", which may be because it is no longer
    being sent, and that was the last value. Treat it as non-persistent,
    with a default value of OK, to clear non-current problems if that is
    the case.

    Climate, water_heater: improve reporting of invalid units.
    
    If unit was static (attached to temperature / current_temperature etc
    dp), there was a possibility that a None value could get reported from
    another dp that was checked earlier.
    
    Also, water_heater only checked temperature, which meany anko kettle
    would report as no unit, since the config has it on the
    current_temperature.

    This helper function is just for translating simple ASCII into more
    complex Unicode units (C to Â°C, m3 to mÂ³ etc) to make editing files

    Now that HA converted most of the unit constants into Enum's, they are

    Bump required HA version to 2024.5
    
    Based on a couple of bug reports, older versions of HA may not be
    working well with the changes that were made for HA 2024.5.
    It is a bit unclear, as there were multiple changes tried and some
    definitely had issues, but it is easier to bump the required version
    than to go back and make changes for the tiny subset of users who want
    to upgrade this integration, but do not want to upgrade HA.

    pip archives.

    Entity naming: use device name if translation_key is device class
    
    translation_key uses device class as a fallback (to allow overriding
    names/icons based on classes in the translation files).  But this means
    we falsely detect unnamed switches with a device class as having a name.
    Check if the translation_key is the same as device_class before telling
    HA not to use the default name.

    Add Tuya cloud assisted setup flow
    
    Pick up the streamlined Tuya cloud login from the official HA cloud Tuya integration. This allows you to get a code from the Smart Life app and then use the app to login to Tuya with a QR code. All available devices for that account can then be select to add locally. Only the IP address still needs to be discovered so a local scan is performed to get that. Just like the final device connection the scan for the IP can fail if other things (including the Smart Life app just used for login!) are connecting to the device when the scan runs so those should be closed before that and the final connection step.
    
    New flow:
    
    Starting page in the config flow allows users to choose to go down the cloud assisted configuration path or the original manual entry path:
    Now you need to provide the 'User Code' available from the Smart Life app:
    Then you will get presented with a QR code you scan in the Smart Life app:
    Once you scan and approve the login in the app, a list of available devices that the cloud account knows about is shown. Now you must select the device you want to add and, if necessary, the gateway it connects through:
    Next the local IP address of the device is found by discovery:
    Finally the retrieved data is prepopulated into the existing register local device page:

    Loratap Relay and Zigbee curtain: remove invalid scale of 0
    
    Some PRs slipped through with the `scale: 0` copied from Tuya cloud
    docs.
    
    This integration uses a multiplier for scale, not a decimal place
    shift like the Tuya cloud uses. This allows temperature scales of 2
    that some thermostats use to represent 0.5 degree steps to be
    represented.
    
    In any case, unscaled values do not need to include a scale mapping.
    
    Issue noticed in the log attached to issue #1930, though this is not
    the device being reported.

    Hydrotherm Dynamic/X8: add optional current temperature dp
    
    An Aquatech Dynamic/X8 branded device appears to be compatible, but reports
    the water temperature in dp 16, which was not present on the original
    Hydrotherm branded device (it may in fact be gen 7). The inlet temperature
    is reported as the cold water temperature at the inlet, as expected, and not
    the hot water temperature as PR #1686 observed.  Both devices report outlet
    temperature as -50, so that appears to be unused.
    
    To handle these together, an optional dp 16 was added as the
    current_temperature, which redirects to inlet_temperature if it is missing.

    BLE plant moisture: expose temperature unit select entity
    
    These sensors seem to need to be prodded to get them to update sensor
    values.  The only writable dp is the temperature unit, which
    previously wasn't exposed.
    
    Exposing it should allow an automation to be set up to set the
    temperature unit periodically. I am not sure whether the underlying
    select platform will filter out attempts to set the option to what it
    already is, but hopefully it will not require setting to a different value
    which might cause flickering in the UI.

    Mark async_actually_start as a callback.
    
    async_actually_start was originally written to execute in the event
    loop.  Since HA was modified to automatically run non-decorated
    coroutines in the executor thread, this has been running in the wrong
    thread, making some of its calls non-thread safe.
    
    - Revert previous fix for #1871, #1872 (PR #1876), as it is not needed
    when actually_start is running in the event loop, and has a side
    effect of causing #1888 (a separate fix for that has been proposed on
    the issue, but this revert also avoids that issue).

    SNT957W devices: apply correct scale.
    
    Based on logs in #1907, all values are scaled by 10, and ranges of
    original PR for temperatures seem to support that.  Humidity is also
    scaled by 10 in the log, so adjusted some ranges to match.
    
    Assume both variants (with and without humidity) are the saame.

    HA 2024.5 workaround attempt 2
    
    Revert previous ineffective workaround, instead opt out of importing
    on executor.
    
    The original issue seems to have been caused by changes in HA 2024.4
    to initialise integrations on an executor thread instead of in the
    event loop.  So when the receive thread is created, it is not being
    created from the event loop, and later gets killed along with the
    startup cleanup (which we previously carefully avoided).
    
    Opt out of this change for now until it is clearer how to adapt to
    the new HA architecture changes.

    We used to be able to compare datetime objects to float, but that seems
    to have stopped working in latest python.

    HA 2024.5 hotfix: do not call async_write_ha_state from receive thread
    
    HA has gone from silence straight to preventing the integration working
    when async_write_ha_state is used from the receive thread.
    Instead we need to schedule an update, and make the update not poll
    when the receive loop is running.

      - light_embers
      - light_indicator
      - light_logs
      - light_nightlight
      - number_timeout_period
      - sensor_time_remaining
      - switch_anti_frost
      - switch_ionizer
      - switch_uv_sterilization
    
    Changes that will require manual removal of old entities:
      - light_uv_sterilization, replaced with a switch
      - switch_indicator, replaced with a light
      - switch_backlight, replaced with a light
      - switch_display, replaced with a light
      - light_led, replaced with light_indicator or default light depending on usage
      - Loycco sound nightlight: light given a tranlation_key of nightlight

    Config: don't default IP address to Auto
    
    Although Auto works when localtuya is not installed, it causes a log
    message telling the user to report a bug, due to the underlying
    tinytuya library not being async.
    
    This is annoying, and explicitly setting an IP address handles dropped
    connection recovery better, so try to avoid steering users towards using
    Auto by not defaulting to it.

    Eesee Adam: split tank sensor into tank, defrost, general problem
    
    Initially this was implemented as any non-zero value as "Tank".
    But actual values reported regularly by the unit include 1 for tank
    full/removed, and 2 for defrosting. There may also be more non-routine
    problem codes, so also added a general problem sensor to catch all others.

    - boost_mode was referenced but not defined
    - "fill_temp" apparently means temperature calibration, and range is -9 to 9
    
    "BoostTime" has range 100 to 900 (seconds), but function is unclear, as the other
    "rapid_countdown" with range 0 - 720 min seems to be the one that goes with switch_rapid,
    so left this as an attribute for now.

    Zemismart roller shade: positions are not inverted
    
    History: this config was originally made with `invert: true` at dps level,
    where the desired effect was not produced. After yaml lint tests were added,
    this issue was detected and "fixed" by moving it into a `mapping`.  However,
    the original presence of that `invert: true` seems to have been a mistake, the
    values should not be inverted.

    climate: remove aux_heat support. BREAKING CHANGE
    
    - already deprecated, alternative entities exist
    - only 3 devices using it (ITS 45HD, Sendo and Vivax heatpumps)
    - HA is properly deprecating it in 2024.4, so log messages encouraging
      users to report bugs will start appearing.

    Royal Clima Fresh: fixes and naming adjustments
    
    - remove preset_mode from climate as it is duplicated as a select and not really related as a preset mode.
    - rename "Fresh air mode" to "Ventilation" and drop the "Fresh air" prefix from the options.
    - fix swing mode logic (defaults not supported in conditions, need to hide some options to ensure the expected one is picked up when changing swing mode via the climate entity).
    - remove unsupported translation_key at dp level

    We already effectively opt out by explicitly defining these functions, but
    the braindead way the deprecation notices work mean we need to also opt out
    with this secret flag.

    ZX-DB11 doorbells: correct ringing type, add attribute to read it
    
    - ZX-DB11 and ZX-DB11B appear to be essentially the same and should
      probably be merged.
    - the original report included base64 (raw) type for alarm, but it was
      missed when adding the device, and later when requested it was
      mistakenly made a boolean. Since this is optional, and only appears
      when actually ringing, this was not detected, and the mapping covers
      the issue.  Later a user submitted a PR for the DB11B which copied
      this mistake.
    
    Based on PR #1761

    IR Moes heatpump: identified more dps
    
    PR #1755 contains detailed info on a Moes IR Thermostat (AC Controller)
    that appears compatible (possibly the very same device).
    This allows some of the previously unknown dps to be identified, and
    some to be exposed as secondary entities, including the raw remote
    controller so the device can be used to control additional devices.

    Beok TGR81: Correct product info
    
    The product info became confused somehow. When Avatto ME81 was
    initially added as a compatible device, the ids somehow became switched.
    But also the wrong name got assigned to the other id. Looking back at the
    original report, it should have been Avatto WT200, not WT81.
    
    Finally, there were detection issues for ME81, so another new device
    report got filed for it later, and a seperate config made (even though it
    could have handled by making a couple of dps optional).

    Ovlaim fan: change speed from string to integer
    
    Original report in #749 did not come with logs, but the documentation
    listed this as a string. But discussion #1728 suggests that this is not
    detected correctly, and the difference between Casafan and this affecting
    detection is only the type of speed dp. Other than that the color_temp
    is present but disabled on Casafan, and presents and timer have different
    values, but these do not affect detection.
    
    There is code from early in development to not be strict about the type of
    quoted integers, so making this integer should still work if there is older
    firmware that really does use string.

    WDYK 2P 63A energy meter: omit last 2 bytes from Phase B and C masks
    
    The phase decoding was originally implemented blindly based on other devices
    in #659. Doc confirming this format were supplied in #1078, but still no logs.
    
    Based on the diagnostics in issue #1717, only phase A appears to use the
    documented format with 2 bytes voltage, 3 bytes each for current and power,
    and 2 bytes for residual current.  Other phases appear to drop the residual
    current, meaning everything else needs to shift by two bytes.

    Peteme recessed lighting: naming change
    
    Keep branding under products, make top level name generic.
    
    This is a fairly common dps mapping for lights, matching rgbww_lightbulb, but in this case it is using the 0-1000 ranges more common in newer lights that use dps 20 and up for light control. It is likely to match other brands though just because there are so many Tuya lightbulbs on the market.
    
    Also default color_mode when it has not been received.

    Avoid explicit returning of None where easy.
    
    Explicity returning None is not necessary at the end of functions in
    Python, since None is the default return code.
    Rearrange some functions to eliminate some returning of None just
    before the end as well.
    
    Shorter functions are easier to follow, so this change helps
    readability for those accustomed to Python.

    Conditional mappings do not support default mappings.
    
    Defaults for conditions have to be set one level up in the mapping,
    as the conditions only look for matches, not keep track of defaults.
    There may be some side-effect to changing this, and setting one level
    up is an acceptable workaround.
    
    In read-write situations that need to control which options are set
    for a specific value, it is sometimes better to list all conditions
    rather than use a default.
    
    Main effect is on climate hvac_action, swing_mode where more than just
    two options for vertical and horizontal are available, cover actions
    where opened/opening, closed/closing need to distinguished based on
    position, and complex logic to handle optional vacuum activate and
    pause switches.

    Holman WX1/2: rename "time left" to "time remaining"
    
    Since this release is incompatibly changing these from number to
    sensor, make this naming change at the same time to the more common in
    other devices, and less ambiguous "remaining" instead of "left".
    This will maybe avoid another incompatible change in a future release.

    Dimming light track: naming and scaling improvements
    
    - add CCT to the name, to differentiate from dimming only bulbs
    - remove scale from brightness, as this is now auto-scaled
    - use a single default mapping for color_temp
    - follow convention of lower case only for attribute names, and avoid "id" as it may clash with standard attributes in future.

    Dongguan electric curtain: naming changes
    
    - Avoid use of superfluous terms like "Smart" in device names
    - Name under products just needs to identify manufacturer and model, the top level name already describes the general purpose of the device
    - no need to name the cover entity, as the class defines a translated name already.

    - do not set any icons
    
    This is a breaking change, as most of these were named either "Fault"

    Timers: eliminate more explicit mdi:timer and related icons
    
    - add `translation_key: timer` to more number and select entities
      that are timers by another name.
    - remove icons from `class: duration` sensors
    
    Explicit timer icons remain for now on number entities that are
    configuring some duration that doesn't strictly match with a "Timer".

    Cleanup: Reformat to satisfy ruff 0.3.0
    
    Ruff pushed all their 2023 experimental changes to stable as a
    "2024.2" release at end of Feb. So the CI linting broke on 1 Mar.
    
    Mostly it seems to be that a blank line is expected between file
    docstring and imports now.

    Translations: fix using translated entity names.
    
    At some unadvertised point, HA removed the deprecation notices for
    defaulting to device names, and in the process changed the behaviour.
    
    Most of the internal components that support translations seem to be
    using EntityDescriptor.name, so our overriding of name is not well
    looked after as a stable API.
    
    Now there is a new function use_device_name, which tries to figure out
    by complex logic, but doesn't get the same result as the old inline
    code. If we override that function to act as we expect, then it works
    but the special meaning of UNDEFINED seems to have been removed except
    for the self._attr_name case.

    Tongou QCB2: expose online_state as a switch rather than sensor
    
    From observing the Tuya app's activity, it was seen that despite the
    name, this is not just an indication of the connectivity, but is used
    to trigger frequent updates of power/current/voltage data when these
    are being observed rather than every 10 minutes as the default update
    rate on these devices seems to be.
    
    Making this available as a switch allows an automation to regularly
    trigger real time updates to keep the data flowing from the device.

    climate: add reporting of TURN_ON and TURN_OFF support
    
    In HA 2024.2, climate devices are expected to report support of
    turn_on and turn_off services.
    
    During the deprecation period until 2025.1, warnings are reported in
    the log if these methods are present and the device is not reporting
    this support. This change will reduce these messages to just those
    devices that actually do not support the methods (using the methods
    would throw an exception).

    Dynasty BTX: add range to temperature, disable units
    
    - add range to temperature so min and max temperature are correctly set, not just defaulting to values that happen to be correct now, but may not be in future.
    - rename temperature_unit and fix unit to C, as handling F properly when the temperature is a mapped list like this is too complex.

    Kogan bladeless fan: change time remaining to integer
    
    Sensor with unit min requires an integer to work. Even if the actual data
    is an integer in double quotes, integer as a type will still work.
    
    PR #1480 comment:
    
    I don't know why but combining the 2 fans, fan1csa and fansa "broke" the
    devices. The became greyed out in Home Assistant. I re-added the seperated
    yamls and they both worked again.
    
    This seems to be the only possible blocker to them being detected correctly,
    as the config is working as expected in tests.

    Got full dps info, but Chinese descriptions/names conflict with

    DPS layout is 100% match for IPS heatpump, but function is totally

    them using the heatpump as a template.

    Use HA scaling functions for fan speed and light brightness
    
    HA 2024.1 introduced some new functions for scaling percentages and
    light brightness. Using these should give standardised behaviour
    compared with other integrations.
    
    User visible changes:
    
    - lights that do not allow brightness to be set all the way down to 1%
      will now adjust their range to use the full range available in HA.
    - fan speeds scale to integers. This mostly affects the speeds
      reported by 3 speed and 6 speed fans
    
    Developer visible changes:
    
    - it is no longer neccesary to specify scale mappings for light
      brightness or fan speed. Since these have a fixed range in HA,
      they are automatically scaled into that range.
    
    - TuyaDpsConfig.range now returns a (min, max) tuple compatible with
      the HA scaling functions instead of a dict with min and max items.

    Kogan aircons and fans: Changes from review
    
    - Arlec 6 speed fan: revert these undocumented changes that conflict
      with the original new device request
    - Kogan KASBKSTFANSA: merge with KASBLFAN1CSA
    - Kogan KABLFAN1CSA: naming changes, use translated presets
      rename to kogan_bladeless_fan.yaml, as it now covers two models.
    - Kogan air conditioners: add temperature selector, naming changes
    
    Product ids on these are suspicious - seems like the product codes
    from packaging, not what the tuya protocol reports.

    light: don't try to set brightness dp when switching to colour
    
    Condition for setting brightness dp included checking self.raw_color_mode,
    but if we were switching to ColorMode it would still apply brightness to
    the dp.  In color mode, normally the rgbhsv includes brightness, so this
    leads to double brightness, or unexpected mode switching.

    Nedis air quality: use new _parts class for VOC sensor.
    
    Since the VOC sensor of this device is using ppm, HA 2024.2 enforces
    strongly that you use the volatile_organic_compounds_parts class
    rather than the volatile_organic_compounds (which used to list ppm
    as an allowed unit, but no longer does).

    - mark 4, 6, 7, 126 as optional, as they seem to not appear for another user
    - based on reported behaviour, try power_go as power, pause as activate inverted.
    I think this was already tried for TTEC vacuum and did not work there, but maybe
    the vacuums act differently.
    - based on commands not seeming to work, make them also trigger power and switch_charge dps as appropriate.

    Issue #1516
    
    Since this supports learning 8 remotes with 8 buttons each, there were
    too many buttons to expose as buttons, so each remote is exposed as a
    select entity with 8 buttons as options.
    
    This is less convenient in the UI than buttons, but should be easier
    for automations.

    TTEC vacuum: add separate buttons for first three dps
    
    Leave the 1/2 combo for activate, but remove dp 3 as power, as this is
    for sending the vacuum to charge.
    
    Add the separate buttons in case the vacuum interface is not able to control
    it (eg device does not like two commands sent at once).
    
    Based on comment in #1393 about a similar vacuum with 3 booleans for power_go,
    pause and switch_charge

    CI: use built in github output format instead of custom parsers
    
    GitHub seems very fussy about regexps, and it isn't clear what it
    doesn't like. Give up, and use built-in formatters in yamllint and
    ruff.

    CI: add yamllint to check yaml files for potential errors
    
    Clean up existing yaml files. A lot of whitespace inconsistencies
    which mostly have no effect, a few indentation problems that might
    have prevented mappings from working, many truthy values other than
    true and false, some needing quoting as they were intended to be
    strings. Also some blank entries for attributes that were filled in or
    removed completely.
    
    Too many changes to list the ones that might have had an impact.

    CI: change from black and isort to ruff.
    
    Changes to black today broke CI, so this is a catalyst to make the
    move to ruff, as Home Assistant already has.
    
    A few issues picked up, and apparently isort has not been working
    (or maybe was reporting its findings without flagging an error).
    
    Also should do general linting, but there will be quite a bit of
    cleanup for that.

    TTEC vacuum: rearrange dps 1 to 3
    
    - dp 1 labelled switch_go in Tuya docs. Seems this should be activate, not power.
    - dp 2 labelled pause in Tuya docs. Assume this works in combination with dp 1 as push buttons doing the opposite thing - combine into activate attribute.
    - dp 3 since dp 1 is no longer marked as the power dp, this can become the power
    dp (it is marked as charge_go, which implies it controls power to the charging)

    TTEC vacuum: remap pause to activate and use command directly.
    
    An activate dp is required to start/pause the vacuum if there is no
    start and pause command in the command dp.  We had followed the tuya
    naming of this as "pause" to integrate the pause command into the
    command dp, but there is still no "start" command.  It is better to
    separate it back out and reverse the logic to make it an "activate" dp.

    To make all commands always available, avoid use of nested mappings by
    flipping the logic so the pause dp becomes the main command dp.

      as it is more reliably available.
    - scale temperatures before redirection. The target scale does not apply.

    Blitzwolf BW LT31: us string for select dp.
    
    Hex is only intended for encoded values. Due to other device requirements
    the hex decoding is done after mapping, so using hex type for mapped values
    that are mapped to non-hex produces errors. In this case, using the string
    without hex decoding is what we want.

    HA 2024.1.2 now includes minor_version in the config, even when the
    integration did not set it.  minor_version was added in HA 2024.1.0,
    so it is not set by this integration yet.
    
    Update the unit tests for this change in HA behaviour, and update the
    pytest-home-assistant-custom-component version to ensure HA 2024.1.2
    or later is used in the tests.

    Smart watering device: remove unneeded mappings
    
    Including mappings of true to ON and false to OFF is just confusing to anyone using this as a template for a new device, as yaml maps these to the same Python True and False values.  The values do not need to be mapped, and are not needed explicitly for a list of possible options, as a switch has fixed options.

    Fix smart_watering_device.yaml
    
    Apologies, I didn't see your code reviews on my PR (holidays probably).
    
    This implements those revisions and I'll provide some context here where necessary:
    1. The device is a small water pump for your plants. The runtime is in seconds because this is ample time to supply water to your house plants.
    2. Implemented DPS 10 as an attribute of DPS 102 (which was missing). Again DPS 10 seems to do nothing (but perhaps the data will be useful to someone else in the future).

    (confusingly similar to Embers though it is) in case other users can use it.

    SmartplugV2 EnergyV2: loosen up requirement for energy sensor.
    
    This is quite a full featured smartplug, and would match many more models
    if the energy sensor and calibration values were optional, as many smartplugs
    do not always return those.
    
    Issue #1409
    - this smartplug contains 3 extra unsupported values: overcharge protection, inching and random timer, the latter 2 of which are complex encodings that cannot be supported.  But for now, this is a better match than the Aubess 1-gang switch it currently matches.

    Setup: print useful errors, allow config to proceed on exceptions
    
    When we get exceptions during entity creation, the exception was being
    thrown to HA to handle. But this loses some of the info such as which
    config file the error is in, and will also prevent other entities using
    the same platform from being enabled.
    
    Catch the exception to prevent other entities from being affected, and print
    a useful error message. There is already a separate exception thrown if
    no entities are available to set up for the platform, so that will still be
    thrown if there are no other entities that would have been blocked by an
    exception being thrown during initialisation.

    Moes star projector: move "color" switch to "background" light.
    
    "Background" light's switch is actually a master for the whole device, to
    switch the background you need the "Color" switch.
    
    The UI would be better with these reversed so the Master switch is separated
    out, and the "Background" light switch only affects itself.

    Motion detection: convert to event where dps were optional.
    
    binary_sensor has a motion class, and some devices seem to always
    return a value, so should remain as binary_sensors.
    
    Only the following devices had the motion dp marked as optional, so
    would be better represented as a stateless event:
    - ble_solar_light
    - pir_spotlight
    
    In the case of the latter, the forced dp would create spurious events,
    so removed the `force: true` and instead default the value to false
    when no value has been reported yet.

    Loratap curtain switch: split null out from normal conditions.
    
    The code for handling multiple conditional values does not allow null to be
    used in a list. There were reasons for that, so instead of changing the code
    to work, change the config to split that condition out by itself.
    
    May fix the case where buttons are not getting enabled, but users are reporting
    that they are all OK if they simplify the config to only work for their
    particular device.  Unit tests show that everything else about the
    multi-conditional configs works as expected, so should not be any different
    than the simple configs that are reportedly working.

    Dry Pury Evo: fix condition on fan speed.

    The entity I had wouldn't actually have covered a Tank full message. It
    only works for E2. Added a secondary bitfield to handle Tank full.

    Add support for VIVOSUN DE0003 Dehumidifier
    
    This PR adds support for the VIVOSUN DE0003 Dehumidifier (also known as
    the VIVOSUN 10L Dehumidifier on Amazon). Results from the Tuya API
    showed that this dehumidifer was really similar to the JJPro JPD02
    dehumidifier, so this config is mostly a copy of that (they even share
    the same name for the continuous mode: Continuities).

    Inkbird BBQ4T v2: decode probe temperatures correctly.
    
    - all probes on dp 107 need to be base64 type (not integer)
    - mask is reversed due to little-endian encoding, and has 4 bytes peer
      probe; it seems 3 bytes temperature, and 1 byte of flags.
    
    DP 106 masks also appear to be incorrect based on the one sample of
    logged data in the original report, but there seem to be 28 bytes
    total, so the actual breakdown is unclear - is it 7 bytes per probe,
    or maybe some is shared config?

    Update tompd_63lw_breaker.yaml - A way to fix polling problems
    
    My device always stopped updating in Home Assistant after about a minute or so, oddly, when I would have opened the app, it would start polling data again.
    
    I snooped around Query Properties on API Explorer and I found this:
    
          {
            "code": "refresh",
            "custom_name": "",
            "dp_id": 106,
            "time": 1702153606980,
            "value": false
          }
    
    Apparently this command corresponds to the command "å·æ°ä¸æ¥" (Refresh report) which you can see on Tuya IoT Platform - *Project* - Device Debugging - Device Report under the same category with the Mandarin name. Apparently the mobile app sends this command when you access the device. I tested this myself, made an automation to press this button every 30 seconds and I haven't encountered any problems since.

    Based on user feedback, dp 11 seems to be a fault code (bit field), and
    dp 1 is not always sent.  The original report did not include logs, and there
    was never feedback from the original reporter.
    
    dp 2 is a fixed string with the model name, so does not make sense to
    have as a sensor. Moved to an attribute.

    Fan: add additional percentage and preset parameters to async_turn_on
    
    Some time ago HA quietly added a fan specific turn_on method that takes
    additional parameters.  In 2023.12 they have quietly broken the fallback
    to the standard ToggleEntity turn_on that allowed this integration to keep
    functioning.
    
    This change is just to quickly resolve the errors that HA 2023.12
    upgrade has caused for fan entities, it does not do anything with the
    percentage and preset_mode parameters, that will need to be done in the
    next release.

    Config parser: Check for strings using instanceof rather than type
    
    In HA 2023.12 beta, the yaml parser has been modified to return objects that
    are a subclass of str, rather than str objects themselves.  This breaks the
    check for multiple conditions, which needs to differentiate strings from
    other sequences.
    - second location that needed changing to fix cases where multiple dps
      are expected to be set together.
    
    - renamed argument from type to vtype to avoid shadowing builtins.

    Aquatech Rapid: remove gratuitous icons
    
    Almost every attribute had an icon associated, without priorities which
    would conflict with each other.  It seems to be a misunderstanding of
    how icon support works.  Default icon should be OK for this device, so
    removed all.

    Vivax heatpump: expand to support Tadiran Apollo
    
    Tadiran Apollo seems to be compatible, but has a few more dps.
    Like the Vivax, not all dps report meaningful data, even if the names are
    all identified now (and likely match the Vivax unknowns, since all others
    seem to match perfectly, and types are consistent)

    Smardeer lock: rename request_unlock as there is no approve.
    
    The request_unlock dp is designed to be paired with an approve_unlock
    in this integration. But this device has only the request, no approve.
    It is not clear how that is supposed to work, so just rename it to get it
    out of the way.  This will mean there is no way to unlock this from
    Home Assistant (but maybe unlock_app is intended for that?).

    climate:  Aux heat appears to be deprecated.
    
    The new climate UI introduced in HA 2023.9 no longer contains a switch
    for Aux heat where it is supported.
    
    Based on a rejected bug report in the frontend repository, this
    appears to be deliberate, based on an architecture decision from July.
    None of the other decisions from that architecture discussion have
    been implemented, so there is no announcement about this deprecation,
    and the backend documentation continues to advertise aux_heat has a
    feature of the climate platform to both end users and developers.  But
    since it is no longer accessible from the UI, it seems urgent to adapt
    to the decision for the 4 devices that support the feature.
    
    Also based on that architecture discussion, only one of the devices
    actually implemented "aux heat", which is an automated feature on heat
    pumps to start an auxilary heater when the temperature is too low for
    the heat pump to function efficiently.  The other devices implement
    "Emergency heat", which is a feature under user control to manually
    switch on an electric element.  Names have been chosen as appropriate
    based on that convention.

    - use appropriate entity types (lock for lock, binary_sensor for sensors with only 2 states).
    - make fault a general catch all binary_sensor. Add full fault code to main cover entity as an attribute in case there are more undocumented faults and someone needs to distinguish them.
    - move second window open sensor to an attribute of the notifications switch, as the Chinese name hints at it being connected to that.

    utils: add name attribute to FakeDevice class.
    
    When an error occurs trying to parse the dp values into the
    matched entity, the error handling is throwing an exception
    because it is trying to output a log message mentioning the
    device name.  Provide a dummy name so it has something to
    log.

    Smartplugv2 Energyv3: workaround for unreported power when off
    
    Some smartplugs don't report power readings (and probably other
    sensors, but the power one is important for the energy dashboard)
    while the switch is off.  This leads to a Riemann Sum helper
    estimating the wrong energy usage during the power off period, because
    all it has to work with is the last known power reading.
    
    Currently the only known device with this issue matches this config,
    so the change is only made here, but the same solution could be copied
    to other configs where needed.  In the case of plugs that do report
    power usage correctly while off, it may be more accurate not to have
    this forcing to 0, as the WiFi module consumes some small amount of
    power, and some smartplugs report that usage (others don't).

    Inkbird ITC308: update test for hvac_modes
    
    Since the hvac_modes now returns ["auto"] rather than []
    when there is no hvac_mode dp, to try to workaround UI
    behaviour, the tests need updating for the new expected
    result.

    climate: revert back to returning auto for no hvac_mode
    
    When we return None, the entity card shows a status of "Unknown".
    
    When we return "auto", in addition to the mode "Auto", the entity card
    also shows set temperature, current temperature and hvac_action
    if available.
    
    The latter is definitely better, even if the mode is wrong.
    
    To resolve the issue of an empty mode select box, include "auto"
    in the hvac_modes, as the card may be checking for only one entry
    in the list rather than one or none to hide this select box.

    Lock: clear non-persistent unlock credential dps on reporting.
    
    When the last credential is kept until the next full poll, if the user

    This can also happen with a different credential if a lower priority
    unlock method is used
    
    Clearing immediately after reporting may mean it disappears from the

    WDYK 3phase: Current/voltage/power sensors missing from data.
    
    Sensors seem to be missing from the data, assume these need to be force polled,
    and mark them as optional so the config matches.
    
    Identified the unknown dps, though meaning of RKWH unclear (reverse energy?)

    Climate: if no hvac_mode dps, return hvac_mode of None.
    
    Was returning Auto, on the assumption that a valid mode is expected, but
    this results in a Mode select dropdown being created in the new climate
    UI, with no contents to select from.  Returning None seems to be expected
    in this case.

    Jiahong thermostat: simplify hvac_action mapping
    
    Reverse the order of constraint and mapping: since power off always maps to
    off regardless of what the sensor says, this simplifies the conditions
    slightly, reducing from 4 branches to 3.

    Inkbird ITC-306A: use hvac_mode for control instead of preset_mode.
    
    hvac_mode allows the device to be toggled on and off, and is easier to
    use in the UI.  on and off are simply mapped to "off" and "heat", but
    pause is creatively mapped to "fan_only" to allow that to be selected
    (according to user feedback it is no different than off mode, but
    according to the manual, pause should leave the display on for
    monitoring temperature, while off should be completely off).
    
    - modify the translations for "thermo_switch" (only used by this
    device) to follow this change.
    
    - modify hvac_action to indicate "off" for both off and pause modes.

    Use HA entity registry to disable deprecated entities by default.
    
    Previously our device config had a list of checkboxes for each entity
    to allow enabling and disabling in the integration config.
    But these were removed when HA made it easy to enable and disable
    entities from the main Settings / Devices UI.  Some code related to
    these was still present, causing deprecated entities to be disabled by
    default, but needing the old config UI to enable them.
    
    Instead, use the entity_registry_enabled_default property to indicate
    that it should be disabled in the registry by default, but otherwise
    set it up as usual.

    Add support for Teberno LED lights
    
    These are a bit problematic, as the logs only show them with dps
    20 (switch) and 26 (timer), but they have rgb and scene dps listed in
    the tuya docs, as well.  Home Assistant seems to have an assumption
    that any light capable of more than just on/off also supports
    brightness, which does not seem true of this light in white mode.
    It is possible that white mode is not really supported, but then the
    initial colour setting is unknown...
    
    Since the log did not show the RGBHSV format, and the
    QueryThingsDataModel result did not break down the fields, I had to
    make a guess that with this dp layout it will follow the newer 6 byte
    hsv format, rather than the older 7 byte rgbhsv.

    Treat empty cid the same as no cid
    
    When processing user entry through the config flow, we get
    an empty string rather than None for an empty cid field.
    This causes the test connection to fail when reconfiguring
    (but not the original connection for some reason, otherwise
    this would have been noticed sooner than 6 months after the
    introduction of cid support).

    Change light color temperature from mireds to Kelvin.
    
    Use the new color_temp_kelvin API for lights instead of the
    old mired API which was apparently deprecated in November.
    
    Implement min and max by setting the _attr variables in the base class
    when initialising.  To support this, added a new general
    `target_range` mapping to replace the hardcoded shifting of the
    color_temp range into the 152 - 500 mired range (2000-6500K).
    
    Configs using color_temp were updated by removing the `invert: true`
    mapping, and adding a `target_range`.  Where no information about the
    range could be found from a quick web search, 2700-6500 was used, as
    this seems to be most common for full-range CCT bulbs.
    
    The following devices did not have the color_temp inverted.  It is not
    certain whether this is because they are following a mired scale,
    or this was a bug that hadn't been noticed.  Since all known Tuya
    bulbs follow the Kelvin scale, no change was made to these to invert
    them (assuming it was a bug that they were not inverted before).
    
     - atomi_ceiling_fan
     - rgbcw_lightbulb2
     - tampa_led_system
     - windcalm_fan_with_light
    
    The following two had some evidence that the lack of inversion was
    deliberate, so the `invert: true` was added to maintain that.
    
     - arlec_fan_light
     - fanco_ecosilentdeluxe

    WDYK 2p63 meter: add dps above 101 mark some optional
    
    Original report #659 only had the "standard" dps documented, from the
    old API Explorer function.  Issue #1078 gives the full documentation for
    what seems to be the same device (photos look the same apart from branding,
    dps list seems compatible).
    
    Differences in logs: #1078 device is missing dp 1, but has dp 16.  Making dp 1
    optional solves that, and adding the additional 101-106 dps per the #1078
    documentation, and 115 and 116 as optional (since neither device reports them)
    along with dp 12 (also not reported, and like 115 probably send only).

    ElectriQ Airflex: provide single DP versions of hvac_mode
    
    The original config for this model also had an Eco preset, so the
    original config used preset_mode mostly duplicating hvac_mode.  After
    it was discovered that Eco mode did not really exist, the preset_mode
    was changed to a hidden work_mode dp, leaving just the hvac_mode
    controls.
    
    But apparently at least some devices do not work like this.
    Originally the reports were that hvac_mode only worked for on/off, it
    didn't change the mode, but after the change d682aff2519, the reverse
    became true.
    
    A proper fix is probably to allow labelling the config as "single dp
    only" and implementing queuing in the sending code to ensure only one
    dp is sent at a time, but the quick fix is to restore the preset_mode
    duplication, and add a separate on/off switch, which can be used as
    alternatives to hvac_mode.

    Geyserwise: adjustments to suit TSE1 model
    
    - Now that logs and proper API docs are available, it is clear that the
      dps 13 and 101 are reporting "On" and "Off" rather than the expected
      boolean true and false.
    - TSE model is designed for PV solar, MAX is mostly compatible at the dps
      level as previously observed, but is designed for thermal solar systems.
      The dps meanings are therefore slightly different:
        - dp 101: Pump status on MAX is PV status on TSE1.  Both are indicating
          whether Solar is being used, just the specific operation being monitored
          differs.
        - dp 102: Solar temperature differential in MAX sets a temperature
          difference threshold for pumping water through the solar tubes.
          In the TSE, this is a target temperature for heating the water when
          solar is available.
        - dps 107 AF temperature and 108 collector temperature are not available
          on the TSE1, as these are related to the pipe system.

    - make the top level name generic in case of other devices matching

    - leave the number entry type to the end user, and defer to the HA default for the default.

    HA 2023.9.0 has altered the config flow return values.
    
    Config flow tests need updating to include the new "preview" entry
    that is being returned.
    
    Update version required to ensure older versions that do not have this
    are not used for the tests.  Since we don't make use of it, this does
    not affect the version of HA needed by end users at runtime, only the
    automated tests.
    
    - minor update to Ditua config: HSV ranges should start from 0 not 1.

    Ditua aroma diffuser: make dps optional for compatibility
    
    Sierra Modern Home aroma diffuser has the same iot.tuya.com info as #627
    But the log captured from the device is missing some dps (fan speed,
    color_mode and on one log the mood lighting select, but on another log that
    is there).
    Make these optional so the configs match.
    
    There are some inconsistencies though:
      - the cloud API has the same small and large options for fan speed as
        in the existing config.  But the Query Things Data Model data
        (not available for the Ditua model) lists "off", "small" and "big".
        If the latter is correct, it is quite likely correct for the Ditua also.
      - the Sierra Modern Home model lists fault code, countdown and
        countdown_remain dps, which are not in the config.  Fault is indicating
        151 in the first log message (128 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1), and 0 in the second.
        Countdown is "0" in both, and remain is 0.
        There is no mention of these in the Ditua docs, but no log message
        in the issue to compare.

    Add support for another variant of Liectroux XR500 vacuum.
    
    Previously Liectroux XR500 was found to match Kabum Smart 700, but
    another user has a variant that almost matches Abir X8, which is
    identified as having a "T3" motherboard.
    
    This differs from the Abir X8 in having additional "Off" options
    for suction and mopping (presumably to use the features separately),
    additional "remaining life" sensors and reset buttons for all the
    consumables, and is missing the "cliff detect" config switch.

    Label Sound type according to Tuya app.
    
    The iot.tuya.com docs seemed to suggest that this was used together
    with dp 10, so the assumption was it selects between different groups
    of 34 sounds.  But the app screenshot shows only 11 sounds selecatable
    within one category, so it may just be filtering the list of 34, and
    therefore redundant.
    
    Since I don't know for sure which of these, it is left in for now, and
    changed to match the app naming.

    Add support for Kojima motion sensor RGBCW nightlight.
    
    Since the dps layout is identical to pir_spotlight with additional
    RGB/scene dps, the name has been made generic as it most likely
    matches other similar devices.

    Quad powerstrip: make sensors optional
    
    The sensors were marked as force, which implies that they
    don't show up by default, so should be optional.
    This should make the config compatible with devices without
    sensors, though they may get confused by the forced polling
    for sensors that do not exist, so there may still be a need
    for a separate config.
    
    Possibly compatible Pearl USB hub added.  issue #1031

    Pinelake camera: add all reported dps
    
    - add SD card status and Alarm linkage, which are locally reported
    - remove optional and force tags from dps that are locally reported
    - change some readonly select entities to binary sensors
    - add classes and remove names as appropriate for sensors
    - removed message sensor, as that does not appear useful as it is binary data
      (may be the camera snapshot, but seems too short)

    Support for Pinelake Birdfeeder Camera
    
    I've managed to make it work somewhat, but:
    - It only works as long as the device is open in the Birdfeeder app. When it's closed, the device immediately stops responding over wifi... Is there any remedy for this?
    - Most of the dpids are not reported when not set (hence the "force" param).
    - The camera doesn't show anything, most likely because the video feed is cloud-only.

    Avatto curtain+light: rearrange optional dps
    
    Latest log shows light present but calibration missing.
    This is more reasonable, as it would allow to distinguish from other
    curtain-only devices still.  Since the device is obviously not
    reliable in which dps it decides to leave out, users are probably
    going to have to retry a few times to get it recognised.

    Although this is what distinguishes the device from a plain curtain, the device
    sometimes does not report the light dp on initial connection, so it cannot be detected

    Do not reverse map hidden values.
    
    A common pattern for optional dps is that we want to map null to a default
    value so when it is not reported, we can report a value.
    To avoid such a mapping showing up as an option that can be set, we can mark
    these mappings as hidden.  But also, these mappings should not be reversed
    when setting the value:
    Consider:
     - a switch has values on and off (True/False), which we just pass through.
       But the dp is optional, and we want to show it as off when missing, so
       we add a mapping from null to false.  With the previous code, every time
       we turn the switch off from HA, the mapping would be applyed in reverse,
       and we would try to set the dp to null instead of false.  By marking the
       mapping as hidden, we can now avoid that reverse mapping.

    - Disable name tests, as things got too complicated with the name
      stuff calling back into HA (which is just Mocks when testing).
    
    - set asyncio_mode to auto, as newer HA test framework requires it for
      async tests.
    
    - use a non-climate device for the option modification test, as there
      seems to be an issue with the climate one (probably to do with
      the naming changes).

    Revert to overriding entity name property
    
    Although the logic to use translated entity names is in the superclass
    name implementation, setting _attr_name to None results in
    use_device_name returning true, as that is the first condition
    checked, and the device name is used instead of the default entity
    name.  This is probably an HA bug, as it becomes quite complex to use
    default name translations as a result, and certainly isn't per the
    documentation.

    Use device class for translation key where not explicitly overridden.
    
    When translations were first added, it seemed that device class was
    designed to be used by default.  But at least for name, this does not
    seem automatic.
    
    Use config_id rather than name in error messages, as name is more
    frequently blank now.

    Eberg Cooly C35HD: make temp_set_f optional
    
    It seems this dp is not always included when temp is set to C.
    
    Be Cool has the same dp layout, but different mode mapping, and is
    detected for Eberg devices, the only differences being a lack of
    select entity to set the units, and the temp_set_f is already marked
    as optional.  Sync these two by also adding the select entity for
    temperature selection to Be Cool.
    
    Remove the test for BeCool rather than update for this change, as it
    is not testing anything unique.

    Migrate entity ids to use device_class when unnamed.
    
    Some older entity ids will be in the entity registry with just the
    platform, but if they are marked with a device_class, the id will now
    use that.  The registered entities need to be migrated to match the
    new ids to avoid leaving zombie entities in the registry, and losing
    any user customisations of name, icon etc.  It may also help with
    finding the right entity in automations etc, but I am not sure so will
    still list the possiblity that automations will need updating in
    breaking changes.

    The original request #777 only mentioned heating ability, and dp 4 was not
    listed in the iot.tuya.com info, though the log value ECO_Heat fits with
    the presets listed in PR #966 for an otherwise compatible Poolsana model.
    
    Move to a climate entity so both heating and cooling can be controlled,
    fill in the presets accoring to our standard pool heatpump presets, and
    reduce the temperature range to the Poolsana range that is more reasonable
    for pool heatpumps (the 5-80 range seems more suited to hot water systems)

    Confirmed in the original report #773 for Vivax Cool, 108 is an unknown bool, so

    is more likely a doubled temperature than unscaled.

    Remove names from sensors with device class matching name.
    
    Issue #871
    
    Now that device class is used as an alternative to name to construct
    unique ids, the names can be removed from more entities to allow the
    default class based names to be used along with any translations.
    
    This commit removes only names that are an exact match for the class.
    Other candidates like PM2.5 are left for a later iteration once
    migration has been figured out, as the stub version pm2_5 differs from
    the class pm25, and we need to deal with the migration issues due to
    class being used in the unique id where the name was previously
    missing (mostly primary entities) before making the problem worse.

    fan: turn off when speed is set to 0 and on when speed set otherwise
    
    Speed 0 turning the fan off used to be the behaviour of HA, but it
    changed recently, probably becaue fans exist somewhere that really
    have a 0 speed.  Many of our configs give a minimum speed of 0 when 0
    is not a valid speed step, so we are relying on this implicit
    behavior.  I think HA anyway doesn't check the range of speeds, only
    the number of steps, and always offers Off as an option.
    
    Also, the new UI buttons result in the on switch being hidden when
    more info is open, even though inclusion of Off in the speed buttons
    implies that it is possible to switch the fan off and on from here.
    So the reverse behaviour of implicitly turning the fan on when speed
    is set is also implemented by this commit.

    Breaking change: Use device class in unique id if entity has no name.
    
    Issue #871.  To make use of Home Assistant provided translations, it
    would be good to remove as many names from entities as possible.  To
    distinguish between multiple entities of the same type without names,
    we need to use something other than the name in the identifier.
    
    This will break existing configs, so a migration will need to be
    written if possible to transfer entities to their new id.

    - move branding into products and follow HA naming convention

    "single_click" from the logs, and we also know from user feedback that "press"
    does not work.

    The newer config is just an improvement of the older one, with more

    these are actually for the same device, they would be better as a
    single config, with the older name taking preference for backwards
    compatibility snice the newer one is not yet released.
    
    Add docs for this and other recent PRs.

    Woods Milan: changes from PR review
    
    - remove "persists: true", the attribute is "persist" not "persists", and the value true is the default behaviour.
    - change mode "hidden: false" to true, as debugging not needed.
    - change hvac_mode auto to heat_cool, per HA understanding of these values.
    - include Swing as swing_mode rather than a separate entity.

    - Make dp 1 (power) a binary_sensor rather than a switch.  As a switch it tells
      the Tuya app that the thermometer is off, but the state of the actual
      thermometer does not change. (may also be the case with iBBQ-4BW?)

    Docs:  iot.tuya.com API Explorer has been reorganised.
    
    Change references to API functions to reflect the new locations.
    The old function to get a single device's information that worked for
    getting product id and local key seems no longer available, but the
    bulk function is available.  Both that and the function for listing dp
    ids have gotten new names in the API Explorer and been shuffled around
    the heirarchy.  Overall the new heirarchy is an improvement, with less
    duplication and no confusingly similar names.
    
    Discussion #823, thanks to @longavailable for the heads up.

    Mark fans with translation_key fan_with_presets
    
    Based on the hassfest errors, it seems we cannot append to default
    translations, so we need to use a translation_key to add translations
    to the fan preset_mode values.
    
    As the upstream does not have any translations, I suspect they have
    not yet got to fans, and in future this may be able to be partially
    reverted, or there may be more disruption when they choose different
    presets (nature and sleep seem common enough that they will be
    included, maybe with some variation on nature).

    Translations: standardise fan preset_modes.
    
    1. avoid "low", "medium", "high", which have a deprecated mapping to
    speed, so may interfere where a fan has both.
    
    2. Choose from off, sleep, nature, fresh, strong, smart, normal
      off: in multi-functional devices where fan can be off and is turned
           off by the preset dp.
      sleep: if the fan had sleep, then that (may have auto cutoff), but
           some converted from low
      nature: if the fan had nature or another mode that varies the wind
           strength, then mapped to that, but it can also be low where
           there was already a sleep and we needed fresh for mid.
      fresh: if the fan had fresh, then that, otherwise generally mid.
      strong: if the fan had strong, then that, otherwise generally high.
      smart: if the fan has smart, then that, otherwise generally auto
      normal: if the fan has normal, then that, otherwise generally manual.
    
      * deprecated fan excluded, as there is no point to force users to
      change automations without forcing them to change entity away from
      the deprecated one.
    
    3. Translations provided in English for the default case ("_").
       Hopefully this works, otherwise a translation_key will need to be
       added to all the affected configs.

    Covers: duplicate position as current_position for some devices.
    
    Some cover devices let position be set via the position dp, but leave
    it showing the last manually set position even when the cover has
    moved subsequently.  For this reason, the cover was modified not to
    trust position when determining if the cover is open or closed, since
    reporting either of those incorrectly results in the corresponding
    control being disabled in the UI when it shouldn't be.
    
    However some devices do report the current position reliably using the
    same position dp used to set position, and with the new code those
    devices have regressed in functionality.  In order to get that
    functionality back, we need to mirror the same dp as current_position
    as well as position.
    
    Issue #715, #794
    
    As devices using simple_blind.yaml are more generic, they may be of
    either of the above types, so a second config was made, allowing the
    user to try both.

    Translations: dehumidifiers commonly have laundry and purify modes.
    
    Some just call the purify mode fan-only, but since dehumidifiers tend
    to have filters, they work as purifiers in this mode.
    
    This partially reverts some changes from 2023.6.0, where humidifiers
    were changed to use common modes as much as possible, so many laundry
    modes got changed to boost.  In some cases, this had a knock on
    effect, as boost should have replaced high, but normal was used, with
    comfort being used where normal should be.

    Thermex water heater: changes from review
    
    - rename file to more obviously reflect the device purpose, in case of
    different branded compatible devices.
    - flip the operation_mode logic.
    
    Implement tests for this device, to cover away mode via operation mode.
    
    Look in into conditions for default, return value not dps_val.
     - required for away_mode redirection to operation_mode.  The siren
     actually expects value rather than dps_val as well.

    feat(device): better debug around why device doesn't match config
    
    When an end-user attempts to add a device, this change adds some
    more detailed logging around why the device doesn't match a known
    config. Details of the required DPs that are missing, or the DPs with
    unmatched type are printed.
    
    This routine is hit when an end-user attempts to add a device, but not
    during normal operation. The decreased performance in the matching
    routine should be acceptable given the improved information available
    and the low frequency of use.
    
    The end-user will need to enable debug-level logging for the component to view this level of detail, so it won't clutter the logs.

    Rearrange SonarCloud scan conditions.
    
    Replace hack that checked out main (regardless of what branch the request was for) before the SonarCloud scan with a condition to only run SonarCloud on main branch.
    Add check that the repository is make-all/tuya-local, as me pushing rebases to
    pull requests is triggering the scan, which then runs without a token since it is using the source repository config.

    Hydrotherm X8: flip operation_mode logic
    
    turn_off/turn_on works better when operation_mode dp is a boolean, and the
    modes are pulled from another dp, rather than the other way around.
    The logic is simpler this way too.

    Translations: provide specific translations for climate devices
    
    This partially reverses the previous changes to use standard naming
    where possible.  Translation keys have been provided for the
    following:
    
    1. aircon_extra:  contains extra fan_mode and swing_mode states to
       cover 5/6 speed fans and 5 fixed vane positions.
    
    2. pool_heatpump: contains custom presets with quiet, smart, quick
       variants of heat and cool.  Because of different marketing naming,
       users will have to remember eco = quiet, boost = quick, and plain
       heat and cool have the smart prefix to standardize across similar
       pool heatpumps.
    
    3. thermostat: contains custom presets for program, manual,
       temp_override, perm_override, and a cycle fan mode.
    
    4. combo_floor: for thermostats that control both air and floor
       heating, contains custom presets cool, heat, floor_cool, floor_heat
       and fan_only.
    
    5. swing_as_powerlevel: for the original Goldair hack of representing
       powerlevel as the unused swing_mode. Overrides the name, and
       provides stop and auto translations for the non-numeric presets.
    
    6. thermo_switch: Provides custom presets for on, off and pause

    Contrary to the portal docs, the log is indicating "single_click", not "click"
    There is also a "double_click" state that I missed.
    
    It seems to report the last action persistently rather than clear the state,
    so maybe the persist: false was not needed, but in case it is, use it
    consistently.

    SmartSMB SMR006: add second variant with 8 byte phase info.
    
    - add full fault code as extra attribute
    - remove the unknown dps, as there appear to be multiple variants,
      which might not report these, or have incompatible types which we
      don't care about if they are unknown.
    - make breaker_number optional
    - dp 103 is Temperature
    - add optional dp 15 as leakage current (maybe only some variants
      report this)
    
    Split into two configs - one with the original 10 byte phase data, but
    with correct decoding based on
    https://github.com/tuya/tuya-home-assistant/issues/495
    second with 8 byte phase data, also mentioned at that link.
    
    Based on linked config from discussion #779

    In both switches, it does not show in the logs, so needs to be optional.

    HCT611: mark missing dps from log as optional, add unknown dps
    
    Original report #638 gave iot.tuya.com docs with dps 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13
    Later screenshots of iot.tuya.com dropped 12 (work_state) but the rest were
    still present.
    
    Actual logs from #771 show 1, 7, 8, 13, 14, 110.
    14 and 110 are unknown, as not listed in the portal (though 14 may be a
    switch for the smart weather function, as per johgee device).
    Assume 10, 11, 12 might show up under some circumstances, and leave them as
    optional in the config.

    HCT611: Add additional smart weather state, use HA weather strings
    
    Device has "cloud" as well as "cloudy" according to comment on #747.
    Map the device weather strings to the underlying strings of HA weather platform.
    This will allow using the translations from there when we can figure out how
    to do that, and also should allow passing values directly from a weather
    integration to the select to show on the device (if cloud does not conflict
    with local control of that).

    Goldair GPPH heater: map power level of auto to 0
    
    GPPH 620 returns "auto" as a power level, others in the series seem to
    return the actual output level when in auto mode.  Since we cannot guess
    what the power level might be, map it to 0.  It may even only do this when
    an actual power level is not available due to the heater being off.

    ZX-M100 presence sensor: sensor is string
    
    The main sensor is a string "presence" or "none", not a boolean.
    Looking back at the original report, the information was there then also,
    and no log was received showing a boolean, nor was there confirmation from
    the reporter that it was working.  I think the assumption was made based on
    another device that had recently been encountered that a two option enum in
    the cloud protocol would become a boolean in the local protocol.
    
    Also, the distance is missing, as in the original report it was not identified.

    Use switch instead of select, force most of dpids
    
    Select was only for 2 possible options, so it easily can be a switch.
    The device stops reporting dpids after a while in the manual mode, so we need to force them.

    cover devices: invert should be inside a mapping.
    
    After previous changes to remove reverse dps from covers, some configs
    incorrectly ended up with the invert setting directly under the dps

    device.py: resist rotating api versions again
    
    When a device has been working using a protocol version, then any
    communication failures are unlikely to be due to a protocol version
    change.  Such changes will only happen after a device firmware upgrade
    which is a rare case.  Instead of restarting protocol detection
    immediately, give another 10 attempts (each "attempt" being 3
    failures) using the current protocol, which is most likely to work.
    
    Recent changes at the request of users who want to detect offline
    devices faster have made things less resilient for devices which are
    having intermittent network issues.  This change attempts to address
    that.

    Use HS color rather than RGBW for colour lights.
    
    The initial implementation of lights made the mistake of choosing
    RGBW, thinking that the W would correspond to the brightness dp and
    RGB to colour.
    
    After implementing though, brightness dp should not be set for colour
    mode, and the lights have either RGBHSV settings or HSV in the colour
    dp.  Since HSV is the common factor, HS color fits better (V is taken
    from brightness).
    
    This changes the UI to remove the confusing and non-working "Color
    brightness" and "White brightness" sliders from the color
    tab. Brightness on the main tab still works.

    Energy meters: standardise units to A, kW
    
    For energy meters, the device's intention is to monitor a whole
    circuit, not just a single device which may be low power.  So it makes
    sense for such devices to return current in amps, and power in kW,
    even if the underlying device is giving mA and 0.1W precision like most
    smartplugs do.
    
    This is a frequently asked change, which can be taken care of in the
    UI, but making the change at least for energy meters should head off
    further requests.
    
    For smartplugs, a nore convincing case can be made that it is a matter
    of preference and that many use cases will be for loads where the
    smaller units make more sense.

    Cover: refactor state logic into a single function.
    
    is_opening, is_closing and is_closed had independent logic, so there
    was a possibility that they were returning inconsistent values.  Use a
    single function to work out the current state of the cover based on
    whatever information is available, returning None if there is any
    ambiguity, to avoid leaving it stuck in a state.  Modify the API
    functions to use the new function.
    
    - update tests for some of the simpler devices, as the state now
    returns None in more cases.
    
    - mark zemismart_roller_blinds action dp as unreliable. Leave it for
    monitoring, but don't use it to determine cover state.
    
    Trying to resolve the issues raised in PR #672, #655 without adding
    internal state, which is likely to get out of sync with the actual state.

    When this was added, I thought that this dp would indicate when the position
    should be flipped.  But now that a few more covers have been implemented, it
    is clear that Tuya's idea of position is always the reverse of HA's, and this
    is just a switch for the motor direction which doesn't affect position
    reporting.
    
    Update configs that used this to always invert positions.

    Update tests for vacuums and Moes temp/humidifier switch
    
    After recent changes, some device specific tests broke:
    
    - vacuums no longer return a DOCKED state unless they are definitely
      known to be docked.  Some tests need to change to IDLE and PAUSED.
    
    - Moes temperature/humidity switch supports many more features.

    Fans: allow speed to go down to 0
    
    As there has been no negative feedback on issue #561, the fix to allow
    speed to go down to 0 rather than 1 seems to resolve the rounding
    error that interferes with setting the lowest speed.
    
    Apply this to all other fans with speed control that went down to 1.

    Revert removal of "auto" protocol version.
    
    Subdevice commit removed the possibity to set "auto" as protocol
    version.  This is not friendly to end users, who should not be
    expected to know the internal details of their device, or to do the
    trial and error to find the correct protocol themselves.
    
    Likely a change is needed to set the correct protocol on parent
    devices when the protocol is changed, and that is the change that
    should be made to fix the issue, not removal of the feature like this.

    Mellerware vacuum: remove scheduled command entity.
    
    This does not seem to be a correct guess as to its function - just
    leave it as an attribute with the original Tuya name "time" until its
    purpose can be determined.
    
    - add `force: true` to some sensors to try to get their value sooner.

    Remove arrays from mappings.
    
    Support for arrays in mappings was added recently, but it is limited and does
    not seem to be working in this context.
    - remove non-error mappings from error.  The code recognizes 0 and null as non
      errors, and mapping them to readable values interferes with that.

    Remove deprecated switches that were replaced with buttons.
    
    Buttons were added in 2023.1.0, which is now over 3 months ago.
    Since most of these are "reset" functions, they probably aren't high
    use, but if the switch was exposed in the UI, or used in automations,
    it will need to be replaced with the button.

    - Improve compatibility by making test_bit and random_timer optional.
    - Make unknown_41 child lock, as this has been observed on multiple devices now.
    - add optional Light mode on dp 40, which seems common (also in other configs).
    
    With these changes, this config is a 100% match for the RDCBC energy
    monitor switch module in PR #599, which avoids creating another new config
    for a fairly standard smartswitch dps layout.

    climate precision: only return tenths or whole.
    
    Although the API is documented as accepting arbitrary precision,
    hundredths does not seem to be working, so stick with the ones that
    home-assistant defined constants for.
    For non-scientific apparatus, tenths of degrees should be plenty.

    auto or manual mode, so make that a switch, even though it partially duplicates
    the hvac_mode of the climate entity.

    RGBCW lights: loosen matching to not require brightness.
    
    Quite a few bulbs seem to only report the dps relevant to the current
    mode.  BrilliantSmart RGB garden lights are one example, the log and
    iot portal info both only list colordata, scene and controldata dps,
    without the colortemp and brightness, but according to info about the
    bulbs they do support white mode with those adjustments.  Some of the
    other novelty light strings and space lamp that we have support for
    were like this too.

    Merged into a single config, as the dp assignments follow the standard

    which are optional.  Otherwise smartplug variations with only minor
    differences are multiplying too quickly.

    assignment, and additional master switch.

    Snap numeric values to the nearest mapping.
    
    Some configs have been made with numeric values with mappings, to mtch
    specific devices.  If step was set and the mapped values evenly
    spaced, this works for things like temperature where step is used by
    HA.  But in the general case, it does not work.  Some of the existing
    configs for light brightness with fixed steps assumed it works in the
    general case, so were broken.
    
    - Aspen ADV200: map brightnesses to 20%, 50&, 100% per the manual,
      instead of evenly space 33%, 66%, 100%.
    - Aspen tests: as this light does not have an off setting, modify the
      tests to allow that, instead of relying on garbage in-garbage out,
      which no longer works with it snapping to nearest valid value.

    Add support for device class to number platform.
    
    This was silently added to HA in 2023.2.0.  Unfortunately it is
    missing duration, which is the most common use for numbers, and both
    sensor and number are missing a class for relative temperatures, which
    is the second (using temperature would cause incorrect conversions
    due to the misalignment of 0 points between Celsius and Fahrenheit).
    
    So only a few instances of temperature limits, and some power,
    current, voltage and illumanance configs can be given device classes.

    simple_switch_timerv2: removing inching
    
    There is no consistency in how tuya devices assign higher numbered dps.
    Since this isn't supported anyway, it is only confusing to label it inching,
    where it may be random_schedule or something else.

    smartplugv2: disable forced updates.
    
    Many plugs seem to misbehave when the updatedps command is used.
    Instead, add a new config: `smartplugv2_polled_power` for the devices
    that need it.
    
    This will probably need some changes to the tests, as the smartplugv2
    will no longer be a unique match based on dps alone.

    - only capitalise first word of entity names (highlighted when they

    - avoid dynamic icons that don't really add value (these interfere
      with theming and user customization)
    - merge mode into fan as preset_mode.  Apparently this clutters the
      HomeKit interface, but that would seem a bug better addressed in the
      HomeKit integration.

    conditions: default constraint to current dp, allow list dps_val
    
    - when constraint is unspecified, match against the current attribute.
      This is mainly only useful to provide distinct mappings depending on
      value (eg to handle multiple devices in a single config)
    - allow dps_val in a condition to match multiple values by specifying
      a list.  This makes for some more concise conditional mappings.
    
    The purpose of these changes to to make it easier to make a single
    config cover multiple devices following a common layout.  Part of what is
    forcing separate configs currently is that although they follow a
    common dps layout, they use different ways of representing enum mappings.

    smartplugv1: don't force updates of power/current/voltage
    
    These older plugs do not use the standard dps of 18,19,20 for these, and
    there don't seem to be any reports of them needing the workaround.
    
    Localtuya seems to only enable updatedps by default for plugs using 18,19,20
    as the dps ids for these, and running protocol v3.3 or 3.4.
    
    updatedps seems to cause problems for Gosund EP2 plugs which use this dp
    layout with protocol v3.3

    smartplugv2_energy: make energy and test_bit dps optional
    
    Energy is sent infrequently by many plugs, so don't require it.
    Test bit is not really needed, like calibration dps, so don't require it.
    
    The only definite difference now between this and the simpler smartplugv2 is the
    Initial State selector.  Overcharge cutoff and Energy sensor are still there,
    but optional.

    Smartplugs: Remove tests for removed legacy attributes
    
    Last change also removed some obsolete attributes from smartplugs.
    Tests need updating, and now we can finish the removal by removing the
    deprecated property from the switch platform and remaining two devices
    that defined it.
    
    Also updated tests to use the config name smartplugv1 instead of
    legacy "kogan_switch" which needs to be searched for in file contents,
    so will be slowing the tests down.  Probably the legacy_type can be
    removed after checking for others, as user configs were migrated
    long ago so it was only used by the tests.

    Add support for a 4-way power monitoring powerstrip.
    
    Issue #457
    
    Although the reported issue is for a 3-way + USB device, the dp layout
    follows the standard layout for a 4-way (USB is dp 4, not 7 as is
    often assigned to USB).  Timer and power monitoring layout is also
    consistent with the standard most multi-switch devices seem to follow,
    so this makes a better generic 4-way than the existing
    "energy_monitoring_powerstrip" config, which uses non-standard dp ids
    for the power monitoring, and does not support timers.

    unique_id_migration: use a unique name for the migration function
    
    Avoid a name clash with the earlier migration, which probably results in the
    wrong migration being done (no migration messages were found in the log, and
    duplicate entities were created).

    Config flow: migrate unique_id of entities to include platform.
    
    When a device contains two entities of different types with the same
    name,  an ERROR is logged about duplicate unique IDs, but things seem
    to still work, as the config_id is different.  Probably customizing
    these entities through the UI will not work however.
    
    If we include the entity platorm in the unique_id, we can eliminate
    these duplicates.

    Catit pixi: set water level device class to enum.
    
    Since the return values are from a set of fixed strings, this is an enum.
    
    - modify sensor.options to only return string options.  HA expects all
    sensors that define options to be enum device class, and actually
    abort the setup if this is not the case.  For some other devices, we
    are using mappings to convert to a percentage scale for other device
    classes, which we do not want to be an enum type.
    
    Add a test to catch missing enum device classes or enum device classes
    without distinct options.

    Meters: Standardize energy sensors.
    
    Energy sensors must be either total_increasing, or total with
    last_reset.  Since we don't support history tracking to detect reset
    and save the time, only total_increasing will work.
    
    For Balance (on prepay meters), it is actually always decreasing, but
    is not really a measurement of energy, it is credit remaining, so
    don'r mark those as energy.

    Smartplugs (multiple): do not mark as energy or total_increasing
    
    Also applies to a couple of heatpumps and thermostats that had power
    consumption readings.
    
    Due to differences in the way different Tuya devices handle energy
    dps (add_ele in particular), it is not possible to get consistent
    behavior without warnings in the log.  Even in devices that seem to
    work, the energy reported by HA is off by 5 - 10% compared to the Tuya
    reports, so it is probably better to use an Integration helper on the
    power sensor rather than using the energy sensor directly.
    
    Left dedicated power meters alone, as those seem to report a running total
    as expected.

    After review of #294, the difference in dp 44 type seems to be an

    working for the original reporter, as their earlier logs showed it as
    a string.
    - Make dp 44 a string, and move it to an attribute, as it is too
    complex to deal with
    - Make dp 17 optional, to allow it to match Elivco.
    - Move calibration dps to their respective entities to tidy up.

    Hysen HY08ACF: minor additions
    
    Based on config from last comment on #343
    
    - add product id
    - add Holiday mode
    
    The comment alludes to a problem with the detection, but no dp
    types seem to be different in the posted config and what is currently
    installed.  hvac_action was renamed to valve, which removes
    functionality, and some values that other users are reporting were
    removed from the mapping, but since this is a read-only attribute,
    there should not be any harm from leaving them in. There was also a duplicate
    of fan speed into its own select entity, but this is also not needed, as it
    is already accessible through the climate entity.

    Refactor:  merge generic/* implementations into the top-level platforms.
    
    In the early days, each device had its own implementation in Python.  After a small handful of devices, the move to using config files with a "generic" implementation was made so the classes did not need to keep multiplying.
    But it took a while for some of the more complex logic in the early classes to be implemented in a way that could be configured using conditional mappings etc, so initially the basic generic implementations were alongside the old device specific implementations, with the top level platforms just doing loading of HA config and delegating to the various implementations.
    
    For some time now, we have been rid of the device specific implementations, and just have one generic implementation for each platform. Since there is a one to one mapping, it is easier to to follow the code if the generic implementation is merged with the top level platform file.

    Add HDMI sync lights
    
    Due to missing dps in most reports, these are indistinguishable from
    other lights, even though they have some unique dps we should be able
    to distinguish them by.  Most concerning is that they do not always
    report the switch and mode states, but sometimes they do so the
    functions are not missing from the device.  These two are the only
    ones documented by Tuya as *required* by all lights.

    Use tinytuya set_multiple_values API function to send.
    
    When this was originally developed, the only way to set arbitrary dps
    was to work with low level functions, generating the payload then
    sending it.
    
    Over time, tinytuya has evolved with a more complete API, so there is
    a higher level function to do what we want.
    
    Currently it looks like it basically does the same as what we were
    doing, but with new Tuya protocol versions coming all the time, and
    workarounds for device issues being built in to tinytuya, it may pick
    up extra functionality at some point, which we would miss by rolling
    our own using lower level functions.
    
    There is a minor performance hit in the case where we need resends,
    but actually it looks like resends are handled at a lower level in
    tinytuya anyway.
    
    Unlikely based on review of the code, but may help with #338 and #372.

    Default device address to Auto.
    
    A new, undocumented feature of tinytuya is that if you give "Auto" or
    None as the IP address, it will automatically search for the device
    (and protocol version, but we probably override that with our own auto
    detection).
    
    Entering "Auto" seems to work without any code changes, so default to
    that as a quick way to leverage this feature.

    motion sensor light: add an "Auto mode" switch
    
    Add a switch for switching between auto and manual.  Since the effect
    attribute is not available when the light is off, it is not so
    convenient only having it there, because you can't tell the difference
    between off and auto modes when the light is off.
    
    Issue #282
    
    To acheive this, the handling of conditions was modified to not try to
    set the constraint dp when it is read-only, and instead require an
    exact match.  This allows us to choose between "mode_off" and
    "mode_on" when turning the auto mode switch off, to avoid changing the
    light state as a side effect.  The previous condition handling was
    selecting the first match for off and trying to change both dps to
    make that condition match.
    
    - as a side effect of these changes, the Fairland IPHCR15 heatpump also
    changed behaviour, as it had a mode dp marked as readonly in the
    config, used as conditions for hvac_mode.  A comment on #222 says
    that despite being described as readonly in the Tuya portal, it
    appeared possible to change it, so to avoid unexpected problems, the
    readonly attribute was removed so that current behaviour is retained.

    Hysen HY08ACF: move child lock type to an attribute on child lock.
    
    This does not seem to be editable as advertised in iot.tuya.com description.
    Even in the Tuya app, changing it does nothing, and it just seems to be
    reflecting a setting made from the device panel.  As it is not very useful,
    demote it to an attribute on the related child lock entity.

    Digoo, Moes, generic RGBW lights: use original Scene and Music names
    
    The advantage to using colorloop and random is that since they are
    predefined, they might get translations faster.  But probably it is
    more confusing than helpful to end users to have them named
    differently than the Tuya app and documentation for their light.

    Get HA to call async_refresh once for each device during startup
    
    Since the persistent connection changes, devices are appearing
    unavailable until startup completes, since we have to wait for startup
    to complete before opening any persistent connection in order to avoid
    being detected as delaying startup ourselves.
    
    If we can make one poll to get initial data, then the devices can
    activate, even if something is delaying startup.  The risk though is
    that unresponsive devices can then be responsible for delaying startup
    as the connection will be active until they timeout.  But since we
    only do this once per device, it should be less of a problem than it
    was when we were polling.

    async_refresh: Update any children that are already set up.
    
    async_refresh is still called in a few places, but since it is not via polling
    HA does not know to check for entity updates.  Use the same mechanism the
    persistent connection loop does to trigger HA to update its cache.
    
    This may allow entities to show some state before startup has finished.  If
    it doesn't, we may need to schedule a refresh after all the entities have
    registered.

    light: modify handling of effect and color_mode
    
    Based on testing, sending an explicit color_mode to switch modes is
    not supported, color_mode is read-only in HA to reflect the status of
    the light, and expected to be set implicitly depending on other
    settings.
    
    Previously, code to set the effect via color mode dp was unreachable,
    since color mode was always initialised to the current color_mode,
    so there was always an actual color_mode to be set. So rework
    color_mode auto setting code to only set it if the current mode is not
    suitable for the arguments supplied.
    
    Update tests for the fact that color_mode cannot be explicitly set,
    and implicit setting only sets it when needed.

    This is much more limited in features than the HY08WE2 that is already
    supported.  Since the diagrams show both hot and cold water pipes
    being controlled by the device, but there is no selection at protocol
    level, I assume that the "on" position is automatically selecting (or
    even mixing) which pipe to open based on current temperature vs target
    temperature, therefore the on position is set as heat_cool in Home Assistant.

    Use new units for electric current and potential, frequency, and time.
    These only affect tests, so this change does not force the use of
    2023.1 on end users, only on developers who want to run the unit
    tests.

    Add a test for async_receive generator.
    
    This should improve test coverage to above the quality threshold for recently
    added code, as it will exercise most/all of the biggest function added.
    The wrapper async task that calls this is still untested, but that is
    relatively small. There are also a couple of optional listener callbacks
    untested, as they have the side effect of starting that task.

    Improve test coverage of device_config.py
    
    Quite a few features built into the device_config logic do not get exercised by any current device configs, so test coverage is lacking.  This commit adds a few tests to cover all except some particularly complex code (which needs refactoring to reduce complexity, which should make it more easily tested).
    
    Also removed the useless feature of being able to override the range for a dp from a mapping on the same dp (the ability to do so from a condition on a different dp is useful and remains).

    Don't register a listener for starting the loop later when Home

    Support for persistent connections.
    
      - create a loop for reading from the persistent connection.
      - read from that loop in a separate async task
      - register links back to entities from the device so that we can asynchronously inform HA of updates
      - remove the old poll mechanism
      - make some old synchronous methods asynchronous, remove duplicates where there were both
      - use asyncio.sleep instead of a separate Timer thread to send with delay
      - send things without waiting for replies (as the reply will come through the read loop)
      - keep track of what was sent and avoid sending it again while we are keeping it to reflect in state.
      - call the api asynchronously in the retry method to avoid blocking the event thread, and return the return value.
      - use HomeAssistant lifecycle events to avoid delaying startup and shutdown

    Refactor: hardcode default temperature unit in climate and water_heater entities.
    
    Instead of deferring to device, just hardcode the fallback as CELSIUS.
    
    I guess the original thinking was that temperature units would depend on the device (US marketed devices vs rest of world).  But if not specified explicitly in the config, we can only really have one default, which is CELSIUS.
    
    This simplifies device by removing an unnecessary property, and removes that link with the history of this integration originally targeting climate devices.

    In the log in #309, the message is obsured because config.name is a

    Fairy lights: separate scenes into a select entity.
    
    Scenes require color_mode to be set to "scene", but if we add an "effect" dp,
    extra values from color_mode are not selectable as effects.
    
    Instead of putting scene as effect, separate it into its own select entity and
    let the additional color_mode show through as effects.

    Reduce retries when using a single protocol version.
    
    Retries were increased when protocol v3.2 and v3.4 were added to
    ensure that each protocol version is tried before giving up.  But

    less retries when the protocol version is fixed will let offline

    Add a third config for Beca BHP6000 thermostat quirks.
    
    Issue #215
    
    When set to C, the temperature in the protocol seems to start equal to
    F at the bottom of the range, and go up by 0.5 for every 1 increment,
    so by the top of the range has drifted away from F by about 4-5
    degrees.
    
    A third config has been added to handle this rather than replacing the
    existing C config, as it is a bit strange and may be due to a firmware
    bug in a specific version of the thermostat.

    Invert the meaning of reversed.
    
    It seems Tuya and Home Assistant have opposing views on what is normal
    and what is reversed.  To make the behaviour consistent we need to
    convert to Home Assistant's view, otherwise the reversed switch just
    toggles between two different opposing views of the state Home Assistant
    sees and the behaviour that Tuya has.

    Don't set api version on startup.
    
    Setting the api version seems to involve a sleep in the latest tinytuya library.
    This causes warnings in the HA log like:
    
    ```
    Detected blocking call to sleep inside the event loop. This is causing stability issues. Please report issue to the custom integration author for tuya_local doing blocking calls at custom_components/tuya_local/device.py, line 297: self._api.set_version(new_version)
    ```
    
    This may be a contributor to #311.

    Allow explicitly setting the protocol version.
    
    With protocol versions 3.2 and 3.4 being similar to 3.3, there may be some misdetection happening, leading to issues such as reported in #300 where the device appears to work for returned values, but does not accept set values.
    
    Add protocol version to the config, with default of "auto" that retains the same behaviour as previous versions.  When set to anything else, the protocol does not rotate to other versions when there is an error, so the user must know what version the device is using.

    Etop CH7100: Merge Auto and main thermostats
    
    In heat mode, different dps are used to control temperature than in cool mode.
    Rather than create a fourth climate entity for this case, merging the Auto and
    main climate entities allows all cases to be covered (albiet with redundant
    second temperature setting in cool and heat modes).
    
    May also fix the error message "Unrecognised HVAC Mode of hot ignored", which
    I think may have been coming from the Auto thermostat not applying the default
    mapping.

    Daizuki heatpump: make dp 101 and 125 optional.
    
    These were captured in the first diagnostics captured from the device, and
    since they are not in the starlight config appeared to be a way to differentiate
    these two heatpumps.  However, later attempts were missing both, so they appear
    to be optional (likely for the starlight too).  First attempt was in auto mode,
    second in hot mode, so maybe these are limited to auto mode somehow.

    Add another generic smartplug variant to better match GNCC 16A one.
    
    Issue #300
    
    This smartplugv2 config is basically smartplugv2_energy with the energy sensor
    removed (strangely it still seems to report the calibration for the energy
    sensor though).
    
    So it is more featured than the smartplugv1 and smartplugv2, but less featured
    than smartplugv2_energy.
    
    This config will not solve the bug reported that the switch does not work
    from HA, but does reflect the state of the switch when switched on the
    device itself or through the cloud.

    climate: overide turn_off and turn_on
    
    Override the turn_off and turn_on functions for climate platform.
    When the hvac_mode attribute is boolean, toggle it without considering
    the mappings so that the previous mode is not lost when turning off
    and back on again.
    
    Caveat: a hypothetical Tuya device that uses True for off and False
    for on will not work correctly since the mappings are bypassed.  Such
    a device has never been encountered, and is unlikely to exist.
    
    Modify old climate device configs which had coupled "power" and
    "hvac_mode" dps to use "hvac_mode" and "mode" instead.  Newer configs
    have done it this way, since the resulting config file is simpler, but
    some older ones had the logic reversed due to old bugs that have since
    been fixed.
    
    This is quite a big change, with high risk of a typo messing up one or
    more devices. Unit tests are passing, so any devices with tests should
    be OK.  Mostly it is the newer devices that don't have tests, which
    mostly did not need modifying, unless someone copied from an older
    config in one of the PRs.

    Tests: improve general config tests.
    
    Add some checks for basic entity and dps requirements that aways need
    to be met.
    
    This is part of eliminating the need for writing device specific tests.
    Lately I have given up on this because the tests are taking too long
    to run, and the influx of new devices is too fast for writing tests.
    
    Ideally there should be a simple declarative test config for each
    device.  As each device becomes fully covered by that, the device
    specific test classes can be removed, leaving only enough explicit
    tests to maintain test coverage of the source code.
    
    Also removed usage of TestCase.subTest, since pytest has a bug that
    hides most of the output when it is used, and doesn't output the
    context anyway.  Instead specify a message in each assert that
    contains the context.

    It seems the device itself continues to indicate true for the work_state
    even when switched off and the heater cannot possibly be working.  This means
    we need to take hvac_mode into account for both states of hvac_action.

    Avatto thermostat: fix indentation in yaml config
    
    Usually such problems are picked up by the unit tests, but this one
    wasn't for some reason.  It became visible only when adding new

    have specific unit tests for the Avatto or closely matching Beok TOL47
    where the issue was observed).

    Avatto thermostat: sync with Beok TOL47
    
    Issue #279
    
    Based on info in issue #279, these two thermostats seem almost
    identical, just one extra dp in the Avatto one, and different
    temperature ranges.  Based on the missing features and unknown dps,
    the Beok ones match, and also the strange mapping of cold/hot/wind to
    manual/program/temporary modes seems the same.
    
    For Beok, adjusted some icons - the random icons that do not really
    match the selections of sensor select replaced with a single icon, and
    the many adjustments with thermometer icon replaced with more descriptive
    icons used in other devices for the same function, to more easily tell
    them apart.

    Add support for Avatto Smart Wifi thermostat
    
    Issue #279
    
    Basic initial support for climate and child lock based on the iot.tuya.com
    documentation.
    
    There are many unknown attributes still, and many config features
    (hysteresis, offsets, internal/external sensors, backlight brightness,
    relay delay, probably fan speeds).
    
    Using the debug method described in the zigbee2mqtt link in the README.md
    can probably help to identify many of these (though experimentation will
    be needed to map values onto their meanings in some cases).

    Inventor dehumidifier: further changes based on manual
    
    - Separate humidifier switch from fan switch.
      Fan switch is off/on as before, humidifier switch is "operation", which switches between air_purifier and "dehumi_air"
    - increase range of humidity - according to manual, range is 40-80 in 5% steps.
      assume these all map to the equivalent string, and use 0 for "CO" since this
      can also be set when in manual mode.  Rely on mapping snap handling rather
      than steps.
    - remap fan speed to dp 112 when in air_purifier mode
    - add Clothes drying mode from manual.  Guess that "drying" is that, and add
      "auto" (guess) for Auto mode.
    - add select entities for light, assuming "1", "2", "3" mapping as per the order in the manual, and for air_purifier mode on dp 105
    - move air quality from attribute to sensor to make it easier to surface in the UI

    Inventor dehumidifer: Allow non-integer target humidity
    
    Another user trying to add their dehumidifier is getting failures because the
    humidity dp is actually a string not an integer.  The values "40" and "50"
    were documented, so it looked like it could be treated as an integer with
    step 10 and range 40 to 50, but it seems the value "CO" (constant?) is also
    a possible value.
    
    Map "CO" to 30 (out of range so it cannot be manually selected - I suspect
    "CO" is automatically used when in the previously undocumented "manual" mode).

    Inventor dehumidifier: config changes based on log
    
    - some string types change to integer.
    - some additional enum values discovered
    
    - humidity is also a string, but hopefully the string to integer conversion works there, as humidity is expected to be an integer with range and step.

    Based on data coming back from light, dp 101 and 102 are integers.
    Values after that are not present in the data captured, so these may also be
    incorrect leading to misdetection if present.

    Stadler Roger: change fan from presets to speeds.
    
    Apparently even though the names contain "auto", this is actually just a faster speed step than "high" (and "sleep" a slower speed than "low").
    So these can be implemented as speed rather than presets.

    Basic lighting functions similar to rgbcw_lightbulb, except that colour
    temperature is not supported, so instead of color_temp, use white when in
    white mode.
    
    More advanced functions (HDMI sync, scenes) requires more understanding of

    Add Inventor Atmosphere XL dehumidifier.
    
    Issue #263
    
    Some attributes are not fully figured out, so have been left as attributes.
    I suspect the following, but need confirmation:
      - 105 Air Purifier should be a switch (boolean) and when on, the fan speed uses dp 112 instead of 4.  105 could in fact be changed to be the dehumidifier switch (inverted) if I am correct, which would separate the dehumidifier and fan on/off controls.
      - 106/107 may be number entities for adjusting some limits? But not clear what.
      - 108 air quality is probably a sensor, but numeric or descriptive?
      - 110 operation could be an indicator or another mode control
      - 111 light is most likely for switching off the indicator/display light (for sleep mode)
      - 112 would seem to be an override of the dp 4 for when purifier mode is active.

    Prepare 0.19.3 release before starting more extensive changes
    
    tinytuya 1.7.0 was released, and I want to update to that for protocol 3.2 and 3.4 support.  But after the 0.19.0 issues with tinytuya 1.6.6, this is likely to need extensive changes to the low level protocol handling so might take a while to stabilise.
    
    In the meantime, current 0.19.2 release is incorrectly marked as 0.19.0 in the mainfest, and there are few minor device and documentation changes that are ready for release already.

    Issue #241
    
    Sometimes the value coming back from the device is None (for example many
    lights do not return color_temp if they are not in color mode, but HA tries
    to read the color_temp in various places if the light says it supports it).
    In these cases, None should be returned from get_value(), but if the attribute
    is configured to be inverted, an exception was thrown instead.

    - Implemented test for siren.is_on, which was missing coverage.
    - Discovered from tests that it was returning a string, the string "off" is not False.

    Retry more before giving up.
    
    Previously 4 retries got us through both protocol versions twice, but from observation it was still sometimes possible for a device to become stuck offline.
    Now that there are three protocol versions, 4 retries is not enough.

    Only switch lights on in turn_on if they are off.
    
    Some Tuya devices seem to have problems with multiple dp sent at once.
    
    Since lights require all settings to be set via the turn_on call, the
    current behaviour of always setting the switch on when turn_on is
    called triggers such problems when setting other parameters.
    
    Only implicitly turn the switch on when it is off, so that other
    parameters can go through to the light alone.
    
    Possible workaround for Issue #236 (has also come up before)

    Use async_forward_entry_setups instead of looping over async_forward_setup_entry separately for each entity type.
    Await it instead of spawning a worker thread, per the suggestion on HA developer blog to avoid reloading while the platforms are being setup.

    Rename entities in accordance with HA guidelines.
    
    In announcing the new naming API changes for 2022.8, there was also mention that only the first word in each device and entity name should be capitalised unless there are abbreviations or brand names that require it.
    
    This is a bulk rename, for entities there should only be case changes to avoid changing entity ids, but some devices have been renamed (the filename is used for any unique id like usage which needs to be stable).

    Ledkia fan/light: adjustments after feedback
    
    It seems that the iot.tuya.com documentation is misleading.
     - colour_mode is always white, never any of the other values.

    Poolex Q-line: use heat_cool rather than fan_only for "mute" mode.
    
    Based on the comment "all are in grey", fan_only may be disabling the temperature setting, which would not be good.
    Also, add a catch all default to avoid the reported error "Unrecognized HVAC Mode of True ignored".  Whether there is another missing mode, or there is just a period during startup when the mode is unavailble, this should avoid the issue.

    Add support for Ledkia fan and light controller.
    
    This has a light type switch according to the docs at iot.tuya.com, though the value is not showing in the sample data captured by the log.
    
    Since the colour temperature and color options only make sense for LED lights, this is used to restrict those settings to only when LED lights are configured.  But if that value is never returned, then it will always only work as a dimmer.  In any case, we cannot know the capabilities of the LED bulb fitted - some are not even dimmable.

    - Add support for a `default` value to be marked in a mapping.  Use this when siren.turn_on is called with no tone value and the siren is not already on.
    - Treat "off" tone specially, use it to turn_off instead of handling in turn_on
    - map "normal" to "off" in the Orion siren config, mark sound+light as default.

    This is almost identical to the GardenPAC pool heatpump, but with the
    following differences:
    - modes are labelled Silent and Boost rather than Silent and Smart
      (control is a boolean, so this is just a UI difference).
    - the hvac mode is controllable between smart, heat and cool.
      GardenPac appears to use the same DP as a read-only indicator of hvac
      action, and leaves the mode in smart always.

    Siren supports volume, duration and tone, turn on and turn off (not implemented, as initial device does not appear to support direct control).  It doesn't contain any standard attributes, however where available we return the standard values as extra attributes so they can be read as well as set via the turn_on service.
    
    - Support Orion Grid Connect outdoor siren using it, along with a battery sensor and charge and tamper binary sensors.

    check their own code, but stops the errors from SonarCloud auth in pull requests.

    Refactor so that the config flow init does the work directly (which since the last commit is just one function call to a common function)and remove the unused old API.
    
    Swap order of scaling and inverting.
    
    Inversion uses min and max from the config, so needs to be done on the device scaled value, not the HA scale as was previously done.
    
    Lefant M213: Adjust to work with M213S.

    - DPS 108 is not returned by M213S (or may be mode dependant).  Since it is not linked to any known function, remove it from the config to allow detection of the M213S as M213 compatible.

    Betterlife BL1500: Better ECO Mode handling
    
    When you set eco mode the heater locks to 20ÂºC which isn't reflected in HA.
    This commit makes HA override the set temperature shown to 20ÂºC and after disabling Eco mode it goes back to displaying the previous temperature following the heater behavior.

    Eliminate configuration of non-deprecated entities.
    
    Home Assistant now has the ability to disable unwanted entities from the UI, and most non-essential entities are already marked as config or diagnostic so should not be cluttering up auto-generated dashboards or voice assistant entity lists.
    
    Removing the ability to disable entities from the integration config simplifies the translations file, which is of much bigger benefit for maintenance than the benefit this feature brought.
    
    Fixes #177, and a number of other comments that contributors have had about the same problem in the past.

    - Move intensity to a fan entity so it can be set easily.
    - rename light_sleep to light_display to take advantage of existing translation
    - rename switch_heater to switch_air_clean to take advantage of existing translation
    - include the temperature unit as an attribute on current temperature so it can be used to specify the actual unit being used.

    2022.4 compatibility fix.
    
    In 2022.2, HA introduced Enumerations to replace strings in several locations.  After just two releases in 2022.4, the support for using strings was removed from categories, causing entities to fail to initialise if they specified a category in the config.
    
    Switch to enums for EntityCategory, and update minimum supported HA version to 2022.2.
    
    Temporarily disable automated testing, as the current version of test harness has a resource leak that causes tests to start failing after the 255th test, and we have over 1000 tests.  The last version without this problem required HA 2021.12 to run.

    Himox H06: remove tuya API style scale/step/range info
    
    Tuya Cloud API scale means number of decimal places to shift.
    tuya-local convention for scale is as a multiplier.
    No scale and step 1 are the default, so no need to include them.
    range is not needed on read-only values, as we never need to limit them.

    HA 2022.3 compatibility: relax the dependency requirements.
    
    Previously exact version matches were defined, as some of the github

    But now that HA is applying strict matching, exact matches are too
    easily broken due to conflicting requirements between integrations.
    Just specify a minimum, with compatible upgrades allowed.

    Inkbird ITC-306A: Add Unbalanced error binary sensor.
    
    In case where the probes differ by more than 3C or 5F, the ITC-306A generates
    an error code 32 (E4 on display), and asserts dp 113.
    - Continuous heat error is actually asserted on dp 120, not 113. (E5 on display, error code 64).  The term "unbalanced" is used, as it does not involve introducing any new terminology in the translation file.
    
    There are also E1 and E2 errors mentioned in the manual for probe fault. And there is no mention of the missing E3, but that would account for the third unknown boolean.  But since there appears to be no order to the existing dp assignment, we cannot guess as to which dp maps to which, and despite the explanation in the manual including "probe unplugged", they appear to be hard wired, so cannot be tested easily.

    - phaseA/B/C encoded instantaneous readings are not included in the local data despite being allocated dp_ids in the cloud docs.
    - energy_reset is a boolean, not a single item enum reporting as empty string as in the cloud API.
    - charge_energy is not available (may depend on device settings)
    - 4 additional integer and 2 boolean attributes are available with ids above 100 (custom ids).

    Handle bitfields specially in mappings.
    
    Until now, bitfields were just handled as integers, as we only ever
    knew of one error code for devices that use them.
    
    SmartMCB had documentation through the Tuya portal of the error field,
    so we could add all the possible values, some of which could
    conceivably happen concurrently, so it is time to treat bitfields
    separately from integers where needed.

    Get entity category explicitly from config file.
    
    Initially when I added this feature after 2021.11 HA release, I was looking
    for a quick solution that did not involve mass editing all the existing
    configs.  But in the course of other changes, I have done that anyway, and
    added category attributes to secondary entities as I went.
    
    Some secondary entities are just as important as the primary entity -
    for example in a multi-switch powerboard, each switch is equal to the others,
    and we shouldn't have one displaying as the main entity with others
    demoted to config entities where Alexa/Google/Siri will not see them.

    Reduce debounce on first call within the same second.
    
    Issue #85
    
    A debounce timer is used to reduce the load on the Tuya device when multiple commands come in quick succession, which was added upstream to improve reliability.
    
    The one second delay it adds to every unbatched command makes the local control even slower in some cases than using cloud control, so for the majority of cases where a single command is given in isolation, it should be avoided.

    I checked 4-5 brand of simple plug (without led or measuring) and it almost all only contain this two dp_id. I think this config help to use this switches all available local function. But also usefull that the original simple switch config is also remain, so i add it to a different name.

    Remove remaining use of legacy_class.
    
    Dehumidifier climate entity is deprecated and the dehumidifier is working as humidifier and fan entities without the features that aren't yet implemented.
    So its removal along with test cases that cannot be covered by the generic climate implementation is not much of a loss.
    
    Remove the now unused legacy_class functionality.

    Cross interaction between power level and "swing mode" can be represented in the config.  Remaining skipped test of restricting values does not match with the
    way that we allow unknown values to go straight through without mapping, but the list of possible values is still taken from the mapping list.

    Add ability for climate device to specify min and max temperature.
    
    Some devices feedback the minimum and maximum temperature range for the mode
    they are in on dps.  Pass this through to the UI so the correct range is
    displayed even if the logic is too complex to model in the config.
    Service call failure will still depend on the range specified in the
    temperature dps, but at least the UI won't have to allow setting outside the
    range to avoid over-restricting.

    Issue #35
    
    Modes guessed based on other models that use "hot" as a mode and the modes listed in the manual.  Manual lacks details of the "wind" mode, does not list it with the modes but says that the device can be used as an air filter without any heat/cool/dry functionality, so assume it is there.
    Also guessed that other fan modes are called "low", "high" and "auto" based on the known value of "medium".  Some other devices that use "medium" use "big" and "small" (direct translations from Chinese), but those devices are all dehumidifiers so it is not a safe assumption that there will be some common source code base with this device.
    One of the unknown booleans is likely the Sleep function, and dps 101 is likely usable as hvac_action, but more details are required for that.

    Avoid errors when migrating multiple entities of the same type.
    
    If a user upgrades after multiple entity configs are available and has already
    configured the same device (an earlier version without multiple entities
    perhaps), an error will be raised when trying to migrate the second entity
    due to the config already being popped off the options.  Give a default when
    popping to avoid raising an error.

    Index entities in the HA data store by their config_id instead of hardcoded strings.
    Loop through all entities instead of breaking when the first is found.
    Currently if there are multiple entities of the same type defined in a config,
    this will create them, but override with subsequent ones (orphaning the earlier one, as it is not destroyed).  Further changes are needed before it is safe to create configs with multiple entries of the same type, but this change is being committed first to ensure the current configs are not affected before making the breaking config change and migration to new config_ids.

    - uncouple power and hvac_mode

        2. 1 or 2-stage heating
        3. 1 or 2-stage heating and cooling

    In config 1, the HEAT mode is not available, in config 2 COOL is not available.

    Saswell Thermometer: rearrange temperature and mode DPS.
    
    Based on new information from Issue #45, the mode dps is 4 not 103, so swap hvac_mode and hvac_action.
    
    Also, the temperature setting is confirmed to be working from dps 2, so use that as it allows more precision.  Assume 0.5 step for C, and 1 for F, which seems fairly standard.  To avoid issues with temperature_unit not being as expected, default to C, and only define F as the exception.

    This device appears to have 3 dps corresponding to the set temperature, dps 2 which is in tenths of degrees, dps 114 which is always C, in degrees, and dps 116 which is always F, in degrees.
    
    Previously we tried to use dps 2, as it has more precision, but this does not seem to work (comment on Issue #45).  Try the others instead.

    Remap scaled and stepped values
    
    If a mapping causes a value to be scaled or stepped due to a default mapping,
    check the map again for a matching rule.
    
    Use case:  For a light that supports 4 brightness levels that are mapped to
    strings: level0, level1, level2, level3, these can be mapped to values
    0, 85, 170, 255 for the standard 0-255 brightness range.  But if a different
    brightness is passed in, we want it to snap to one of those values
    - a step of 85 as the default mapping should do that, but we need to pass
    it back through the mapping after snapping to the step to translate to the
    strings.

    Rename some more config files before releasing the migration.
    
    Based on the initial request for Tadiran support, there seem to be other variants.
    Based on error reports, there seem to be other variants of Kogan heaters also.
    
    Avoid needing to redo the migration again later by renaming those now.

    Migrate legacy types to config filename based types.
    
    It is more efficient to load config files based on the type, rather than having
    to iterate through all configs looking for the matching legacy_type.
    
    Change legacy type in smartplugv2 to kogan_switch2 to tie it back to the old
    config name.  kogan_switch has special handling in the migration to handle
    mapping to the old shared legacy_type.

    Rename some configs that ended up being ambiguously named.
    
    - Kogan Switch/Kogan Switch 2 seem to be common configs for smartplugs sold
      under other brands, so make them a more generic name.
    - Inkbird Thermostat - based on info elsewhere, 308A is completely different than 306A, so make this specific to 306A to avoid confusion.
    - Electriq Dehumidifier was for CD25PRO, which was already found incompatible with CD20PRO

    DPS 104, which was previously configured as boolean for swing mode was a string
    ('low') in the log, so rename to unknown for observation. Probably it is still
    swing_mode, but not as true/false, maybe "low", "mid", "high", "swing", with
    3 settings for vane positions when not oscillating. "swing" may be "auto" or
    some other string.

    According to comments in HA climate/const.py, auto is for temperature set by
    a schedule, AI or other non-user controlled mechanism.  What most heatpumps
    have labelled as "Auto" is called heat_cool (set a temperature, and the heatpump
    switches between heating and cooling automatically depending on what is needed).

    Prefer non-legacy types.
    
    Instead of searching through all config files for legacy types, first try
    loading the config of that name directly. Only if that fails revert to using
    legacy types.
    
    This should speed up loading of non-legacy devices.  Later changes will save
    the non-legacy type in the config, and migrate existing config entries.

    Identify the integration consistently as "Tuya Local".
    
    The different wording in HACS, Integrations UI and github project name are
    likely to be confusing, and may have already been responsible for Issue #21.
    
    Although it is also confusing when another unrelated popular integration
    is called Local Tuya, it seems like it will be disruptive to change the
    actual integration name.  But maybe migration will help, so I may look into
    that in future too.
    
    Also bumped the version in the manifest, which has been forgotten the past

    Remove the explicit stringify property from the config files.
    Instead, detect when reading the property whether it is quoted, and if so,
    quote it when writing too.
    
    This compensates for the fact that previously added devices did not pay much
    attention to this, and future software updates may change the use of quotes
    for those devices that do come marked as stringified.

    Handle conditional re-mapping of values.
    
    Use it instead of complex mix of range and mapping in fan climate config.
    Only one test remains skipped in fan, which is that fan mode cannot be set when no preset is set. But since that doesn't happen in reality, we can probably switch to using the generic climate class for fan now, leaving only dehumidifier and gpph heater legacy classes.

    Default options form values from existing config.
    
    Options schema was copied from the relevant parts of the initial config schema,
    which meant that the defaults were missing for some options, and set based on
    default assumptions for others.  Default them to the existing values, which
    is more useful for reconfiguring existing devices.

    Ensure cached state is fetched before use.
    
    async_inferred_type was getting the cached_state, then looping over
    async_possible_types, relying on that to ensure the cached_state was fetched
    from the device.  Then it was using its own copy of cached_state to make
    the decision about match quality.  But if that copy was taken before the
    state is fetched from the device, it is empty.  Defer getting the copy of
    cached state until inside the loop.

    Migrate config.
    
    - "auto" no longer allowed as a device type, a concrete type must be selected.
        This opens the door to having different devices with the same DPS but
        different presets for example.  Such devices cannot be distinguished
        automatically so we need the user to explicitly set each one.
    - "child_lock" renamed to "lock"
    - "display_light" renamed to "light"
         This opens the door to adding other light and lock devices that are not
         display lights or child locks.
    - No longer import yaml config.
         As the config format has changed, no longer import yaml config.
         Although it was marked deprecated only for a short time, the yaml was
         always imported, so existing configurations will work from the device
         registry import after migration.
    - Update the config flow.
         - Break config into three stages.
             Information gathered based on earlier config can be used to improve
             the flow by filtering only available options.
         - Filter devices to just those that are possible matches.
         - Filter entities to those available on the selected device.

    Resolve CONF_TYPE_AUTO once per device.
    
    During init, when device type is set to auto, the device needs to be polled once before the device type can be resolved.  But when creating multiple entities per device, the reply from the earlier entities still hasn't come back, so we may end up creating multiple refresh requests.
    Resolve the CONF_TYPE before setting up platforms so that the platforms can
    be setup more quickly.
    
    Also, reverse the logic for deciding when to rotate the protocol version, so that devices that have never communicated rotate immediately for faster detection.

    Deprecate YAML configuration.
    
    Soon work will start on improving the config flow.  I do not want to be
    held back by legacy config format issues, so deprecating YAML now.
    It is already imported since before the start of the fork, but currently
    does not allow reconfiguration of imported config, and picks up changes
    from yaml config.
    
    Next step will be to ignore yaml config, and allow previously imported
    config to be modified from the options flow.  After that, migrations will
    not be blocked by the need to keep importing the legacy yaml config.

    Tuya devices take some time to be ready for the next call, so setting two

    Expose a method in device_config helper to just return the dps that would be
    set without actually setting them, and use these when setting high and low
    target temperatures.

    the primary device (or maybe I'll get rid of the concept of primary and secondary altogether).  I'm not sure what happens if both are configured together. If there are no ill effects, I'll probably leave both configurations as it comes down to personal choice which to use.

    as a humidifier offering a humidifier and a climate option depending

    Eanons Humidifier is added as a climate device (since that is what is currently supported, and like the Goldair Dehumidifier, this seems to have fan mode control which is missing from the humidifier entity in Home Assistant.
    
    But with both devices, the fan mode appears to be coupled to presets, and can be covered by presets, so in future I will implement a generic humidifier entity and change both devices to that (will also require a generic sensor entity to surface the temperature sensor on the Goldair dehumidifier more usefully than as an attribute).

    When the device is set to Farenheit, it is going to need a different range.

    18-35, but the user who submitted the request was adament that it goes beyond

    GPPH heater config: add values in map even though they are the same as dps_val.
    
    This list of dps_val was supposed to indicate that the dps is an enum, with a list
    of fixed values to choose from.
    When handling these, we actually check values, not dps_val.  But if we leave off the dps_val, they all become defaults, which will override any dps_val.
    To avoid overcomplicating the handling code, include values for these.

    Round the quality.
    
    It doesn't really affect anything other than the debug ouput looking nicer.
    
    I don't think it is possible to have 100+ dps, so the rounding shouldn't make
    off-by-one mismatches appear falsely as matches.

    Ignore type when mapping, and improve handling of defaults.
    
    There was an issue where defaults could clobber specific values if encountered later in the loop.
    When checking values in the map, convert to string so type differences do not prevent matching.  This happens when config files map integer values, but the Tuya API surrounds them in quotes.

    Refresh cache when it is less than one in length.
    
    The change from checking for specific dps to checking length was assuming
    that the "updated_at" timestamp was always present.  When we set up mocks for
    tests, that is not always the case, so allow for the case where it is missing.

    I think this only happens in tests, and it is not clear to me why it has
    suddenly become a problem now, but checking is better in case the cache is
    completely cleared in actual use.

    Output retry log message as debug instead of warning.
    
    Although it is a communication failure, it is expected when the protocol
    version has not been detected yet. For persistent failures there is an error
    log message after the retry limit is reached.
    
    Include the device name in most log messages, making it easier to see what is
    happening.
    
    Don't count updated_at entry when judging match quality.
    
    dps from tinytuya api has an updated_at entry in addition to actual dps.
    Don't let this lower the match quality.
    This should move everything from an 83.3-92.85% match to a 100% match.

    - gpcv_heater
    - gsh_heater

    Still not 100%, as the components cover some cases that our current config files don't use.  Probably some test configs are needed to fully exercise the generic classes ahead of any real device using them.

    Fix unit tests
    
    Unit test mocking was not able to work with previous change, so revert to importing all of tinytuya instead of only required portions.

    Modify payload command for tinytuya
    
    pytuya supported two commands ("status" and "set"). For status, the higher level status()
    method is used, which still works. But for set, in order to set multiple dps at once,
    the lower level generate_payload method is used, passing in the commands. But tinytuya
    has changed to use int commands defined as constants: AP_CONFIG, CONTROL, STATUS,
    HEART_BEAT, DP_QUERY, CONTROL_NEW, DP_QUERY_NEW, UPDAtEDPS are the new commands, with
    some differences for devices with 22 character IDs.  Equivalant of "status" is DP_QUERY
    and equivalent of "set" is CONTROL, though some devices may need DP_QUERY_NEW and
    CONTROL_NEW by the looks of the protocol (it does not appear that tinytuya handles this
    automatically, unfortunately).

    Switch out the underlying library to tinytuya.
    
    pytuya is unmaintained, and there seem to be several improved versions since by Tradeface (also seems to be abandoned) and James Cox (tinytuya) which still seems to be actively maintained.
    
    Hopefully this will improve reliability, especially with the 3.3 protocol version, which still seems flakey with pytuya.  We may need to look at using some of the higher level methods to take advantage of some of the improvements, as the current Device implementation works with some underscore methods that were probably intended to be internal.

    Rename some fields for consistency.
    
    primary_device renamed to primary_entity, since in HA device refers to the whole device, and each functional part is an entity.
    
    secondary_devices renamed to secondary_entities for the same reason.
    
    value under conditions changed to dps_val to be consistent with mappings. The values for comparison are also changed to be raw DPS values before any mapping.
    
    value-override under conditions changed to value.  After renaming the above, there is no conflict, so the naming and meaning can be consistent with mappings.

    There appear to be other brands of switches using the same DPS layout, and
    the schemas for these list 21 as a test mode, and the others as calibration

    Avoid switching protocols once communication is working (#37)
    
    * Be less eager about changing protocol.
    
    Once the device is communicating, only switch protocols after the connection retry limit is reached.
    This prevents compounding the problem, in particular when v3.3 protocol devices send back responses that pytuya does not handle, as switching to v3.1 seems to cause these devices to go offline for a few minutes sometimes.

    Add synchronization when checking if it is time to refresh state.
    
    When checking if it is time to refresh status, there is possibility of a race
    condition when there are two or more entities assigned to a device, where both
    request status at the same time, and both check the last update time before
    either can update the update time.
    
    - Fix syntax error in last checkin.

    Use lock when getting status from device.
    
    Sending commands to the device was protected by a lock, but getting status
    could still run in parallel.
    This can cause the device to fail to respond, as the Tuya firmware only seems to handle one connection at a time.
    Use the same lock so that status requests will wait for commands before firing.

    Be less eager about rotating the protocol version once it is working
    
    Sometimes devices fail to respond, or respond with a response that pytuya
    cannot parse.  This happens especially with the encrypted 3.3 protocol.
    Rotating the protocol version seems to make the problem worse, causing the
    device to stop responding for some time.
    Let the retry counter reach _CONNECTION_ATTEMPTS before starting to rotate
    the protocol version if we have successfully communicated until then.

    Based on changes in KiLLeRRat/homeassistant-goldair-climate and the manual for GECO/GPEH heaters, the DPS arrangement for GECO seems the same as GPCV, but this model does not have the High and Low modes which we exposed as PRESET_MODE in the GPCV so may generate errors if configured as GPCV.
    
    This heater appears cosmetically and functionally the same as GEPH, so hopefully it works with these as well.

    Add support for GPCV and GECO series heaters.
    
    These are different than the GPPH series heaters that are already supported.
    See Issue #27
    
    Based on changes in KiLLeRRat/homeassistant-goldair-climate and the manual for GECO/GPEH heaters, the DPS arrangement for GECO seems the same as GPCV, but this model does not have the High and Low modes which we exposed as PRESET_MODE in the GPCV so may generate errors if configured as GPCV.
    
    This heater appears cosmetically and functionally the same as GEPH, so hopefully it works with these as well.

    Swap symlinks around to avoid HACS breakage.
    
    Symlinks are trying to support different versions of HomeAssistant.
    Latest 0.109 uses translations/en.json, so make that the master copy of
    the file, and make strings.json a symlink to that.
    Update hacs.json to indicate 0.109 is the minimum version - although the
    source code supports 0.96 and later, the way HACS breaks the symlinks on
    installation means it will only work on 0.109 if installed through HACS.

    Numeric error codes are easier to deal with in automations and template sensors.
    Descriptive errors may be subject to change.
    
    - Make unknown errors more descriptive.
    - Make error "OK" for heater when there is no error. null looks like something is wrong.

    Use OK for the no error value.
    
    OK is more concise and makes more sense in the UI for a "tank status".
    Also, modify the logic to ensure that 0 does not skip conversion to a string,
    and subsequently get converted to None.

    Dehumidifier states represented by icons:
     - Normal
     - Tank full or missing
     - Defrosting
    
    Heater states represented by icons:
     - Heating (HVAC mode is Heat and power level is not "stop"; this means
       that when you have the power mode set to Auto and the heater stops
       heating because the temperature is high enough, the icon will switch
       to idle to represent this state)
     - Idle
    
    Fan is now a fan but has no dynamic states.
    
    Also fixed a bug with manual power modes breaking the swing mode

    Swap target temperature and current temperature for Kogan heater
    
    Initial analysis of the heater values was wrong.
    This makes it more similar to the Goldstar heater, which makes sense.

    Add support for Kogan Heaters
    
    These are simpler heaters than the Goldair ones, with only two presets for High and Low, and no control of panel lighting, child lock etc.

    Automatically switch protocol versions to find the best one

    Automatically switch protocol versions to find the best one
    
    There are two protocol versions that Goldair devices may use. Rather
    than requiring that the user know which one and put it in the config, a
    more automatic solution is to just switch the version when there is a
    communication error. There may be some false positives when network
    connectivity is low, but it's a much nicer solution than putting it on
    the user.
